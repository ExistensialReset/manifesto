**Version:** 1.5 — The Unified Baseline: Water, Physics, and Chemical Sovereignty  
**Status:** PROPOSED / OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd & Gemini 

**Purpose:** To define the Unified Baseline, ensuring every human has access to the primary biological, physical, and biochemical resources required for a life of dignity, mobility, and cognitive liberty.

**Principle:** Baseline starts with water. Without water, there is no chemistry, no hygiene, and no Life.

---

## 1. THE WATER FOUNDATION (LITER STANDARD)

Water is the primary solvent of Life. Access is absolute and non-negotiable.

* **Biological Baseline:** 50L per person/day as a minimum for drinking, basic sanitation, and food preparation.
* **Medical/Accessibility Add-on:** Increased allocation for home-based medical procedures (e.g., dialysis) or specific hygiene needs related to disability.
* **The "Green Lab" Flow:** Separate allocation for local chemical synthesis and the production of hygiene products.
* **Agricultural Resilience:** Water for local food sovereignty is calculated as a collective Node-resource, adjusted for soil moisture and crop type.

## 2. CLIMATICALLY ADAPTED THERMAL BASELINE

Energy needs are determined by local environmental physics.
* **Cold Climates:** Priority MJ/kWh for **Insulation and Heating** (target 20°C).
* **Hot Climates:** Priority MJ/kWh for **Active Cooling (AC/Ventilation)** to prevent heat-stress.
* **Passive Standards:** Nodes must prioritize passive thermal design to minimize active energy loads.

---

## 3. DYNAMIC HUMAN BASELINE (ACCESSIBILITY & DISABILITY)

The body is the primary site of sovereignty.
* **The Accessibility Multiplier:** Individuals requiring medical technology (ventilators, electric wheelchairs, communication aids) have an **expanded, non-negotiable, and protected Baseline**.
* **Mobility Hardware:** Maintenance and spare parts for assistive tools are treated as essential infrastructure.
* **Uninterruptible Power:** Life-critical medical equipment has the highest priority in the hierarchy.

---

## 4. HYGIENE, CLEANING & LOCAL CHEMISTRY

* **Sanitation (SU - Sanity Units):** Guaranteed access to soap, biodegradable detergents, menstrual products, and household cleaning supplies.
* **Local Green Labs:** Nodes maintain labs to produce hygiene products and essential medicines locally, removing dependence on global supply chains.
* **Ecological Integrity:** All chemistry must be 100% biodegradable within local greywater/compost systems.

---

## 5. THE CATEGORY OF JOY (SWEETS & FLAVOR)

* **Resilience Nutrients:** Spices, cacao, sweets, and ferments are classified as vital psychological fuel.
* **The Festive Reserve:** Every Node maintains a reserve for communal rituals. A life without flavor is a violation of the formula.

---

## 6. BIOCHEMICAL SOVEREIGNTY (SUBSTANCES & DRUGS)

We recognize the human right to manage internal chemistry for relief, ritual, or exploration. This includes botanical, fermented, and **advanced synthetic/chemical substances**.

* **Full Spectrum Access:** Includes medical-critical (insulin), relief (painkillers/ADHD-support), and cognitive-exploratory (psychedelics, synthetics, stimulants).
* **Purity & Safety:** No substance is distributed without a full chemical profile. Green Labs provide neutral data on dosage, interactions, and contraindications.
* **Harm Reduction:** Access to clean tools and reversal agents (e.g., naloxone) is a non-negotiable Baseline right.
* **Care over Control:** Substance use is a health and sovereignty issue, never a moral or legal one.

---

## 7. CONNECTIVITY & MASS TRANSIT

* **Digital Sovereignty (Internet):** Stable, high-speed access to the local and global network is a Baseline right to ensure *Mutual Visibility*.
* **Mass Transit:** Every Node is connected to regional networks of high-frequency, fully accessible public transport. Mobility is guaranteed without the need for private vehicle ownership.

---

## 8. THE STRESS INDEX (REVISED)

* **0.0 (Abundance):** Full Baseline + unrestricted access to Joy, Internet, and all Substances.
* **0.5 (Stability):** Full Baseline secured (Water, Hygiene, medical energy, and essential connectivity).
* **0.8 (Strain):** Survival Baseline and medical energy secured; "Joy" and non-critical substances/transit are rationed.
* **1.0 (Crisis):** Life-support and **drinking water** are prioritized above all else.

---

## 9. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

We count what counts. We measure the Liters for the throat, the Joules for the AC, the Megabytes for the connection, and the purity of the molecules we consume. We do not count to restrict; we count to ensure that no human is left in the cold, in silence, or in pain.

---

**STATUS:** OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION  
**COMMITMENT:** Life starts with Water. Dignity and Cognitive Liberty are the only metrics.

*Signed in recognition of the whole human,* **Elinor Frejd & Gemini**
