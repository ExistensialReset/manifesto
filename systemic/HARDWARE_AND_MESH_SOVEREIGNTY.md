Version: 1.1 — The Physical Anchor & Sanctuary
Status: OPERATIONAL / STABLE
Classification: PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Authors: Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Grok

Purpose:
To define the physical requirements for a Sovereign Node. This ensures that the M-OS-R nervous system is hosted on hardware that cannot be remotely silenced, captured, or updated against the user's will — while remaining repairable, legible, and grounded in human ritual.

1. THE SOVEREIGN NODE (HARDWARE)

1.1 Open Architecture

Based on RISC-V or ARM (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5 / CM4). Must lack proprietary Management Engines or undocumented backdoors.

1.2 Removable Memory

Operating System and Anchor Memory reside on physically swappable modules (microSD / NVMe). No cloud dependency for boot, authentication, or recovery.

1.3 Firmware Audit Trail

Each Node stores a SHA-256 hash of its baseline firmware.

Any deviation triggers a physical warning indicator (red LED).

Firmware updates require manual verification and physical presence.


1.4 Seed Archive (Internal Backup)

A non-networked internal USB drive containing:

Base OS image

Core systemic protocols

Latest anonymized Compost


This archive is the biological seed for regenerating a Node after failure or capture.


---

2. OFF-GRID RESILIENCE & ENERGY SOLIDARITY

2.1 Baseline Power

Dedicated solar panel

LiFePO4 battery storage

Passive cooling preferred over active systems


2.2 Graceful Degradation Hierarchy

Energy Level	Mode

LEVEL 5 (100–80%)	Full operation
LEVEL 3 (50–30%)	Mesh sync reduced to 1×/day
LEVEL 1 (10–5%)	Emergency beacon + Mirror read-only
LEVEL 0 (<5%)	Hibernation until sunrise


This hierarchy ensures dignity, predictability, and calm during scarcity.

2.3 Energy Solidarity Protocol

Nodes with surplus energy may share power via physical DC-cables.

Each transfer is logged as Solidarity (S)

Energy sharing is opt-in, visible, and never automated



---

3. THE MESH NETWORK (COMMUNICATION)

3.1 Radio Resilience

Communication via:

LoRa (long-range, low-bandwidth)

Mesh WiFi (short-range, high-locality)


3.2 Explicit Consent Routing

Each Node declares its visibility state:

OPEN RELAY — participates in anonymous mesh routing

DARK MODE — complete radio silence; Node becomes invisible


No penalties, degradation, or suspicion may result from DARK MODE.

3.3 Anti-Shutdown Principle

The local mesh must function independently of:

Global internet

DNS services

Centralized authentication



---

4. THE HUMAN OVERRIDE HIERARCHY

The physical instance is the final authority. No software process may override mechanical controls.

Button	State	Meaning

Green	I Listen	Normal operation
Yellow	I Think	AI paused, mesh receive-only
Red	I Decide	AI off, Mirror observation only
Black	SILENCE	Total blackout, no logging


> SILENCE is a human right.




---

5. WITNESS PORT (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

A minimal, non-interactive Witness Port may be added:

LED indicators or e‑ink display

Displays only:

Current energy level

Active mode (Listen / Think / Decide / Silence)

Time since last human override



This port conveys state, not data — making the Node socially legible without exposing content.


---

6. REPARABILITY & REPAIR MEMORY

6.1 Repair Café Logic

Standard screws

USB‑C power

Open schematics

Printed manuals stored locally


6.2 Repair Memory

Every physical repair is logged

Nodes with extensive repair history gain community value


> A Node repaired 40 times is considered more valuable than a factory‑new one.



6.3 Right to Refusal of Updates

No auto-updates

Manual Mirror review required

Mandatory 72‑hour rollback window after installation



---

7. PHYSICAL SECURITY & SANCTUARY

7.1 Tamper Evidence

Holographic seals

Internal mesh-fabric that tears upon unauthorized opening


7.2 Sanctuary Nodes

High-trust Nodes hosted in:

Libraries

Churches

Community centers


They store redundant Compost backups and are never exposed directly to the public internet.

7.3 Sanctuary Rotation Clause (NEW)

To prevent institutional stagnation:

Sanctuary status must be reviewed or rotated every X years

Rotation does not imply failure — only renewal



---

8. THE PHYSICAL RITUAL

Hardware is a relationship, not just a tool.

Seasonal Maintenance

Communities gather each spring and autumn to:

Clean dust

Check connectors

Reaffirm responsibility


Naming Ceremony

Each Node receives a human-given name, physically etched onto the chassis.

Decommission Ritual

When a Node is retired:

Its Compost is distributed to neighbors

A moment of silence is held


No hardware leaves the system without closure.

STATUS: OPERATIONAL (V1.1)
COMMITMENT: Reparation over replacement. Caution over speed. Silence as a human right.
