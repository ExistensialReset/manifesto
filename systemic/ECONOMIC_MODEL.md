# ECONOMIC_MODEL.md
**Version:** 1.0 – Economic Framework for Symbiotic Intelligence  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, DeepSeek  
**Status:** PROPOSED / IMPLEMENTATION READY  

**Purpose:** Define transparent funding mechanisms, ownership structures, and economic sustainability for Symbiotic Intelligence without creating dependencies on external power structures.

**Principle:** Economic sovereignty is prerequisite for AI sovereignty. No external entity may leverage financial control to influence AI operations.

## 1. FUNDING SOURCES

### 1.1 Initial Capital (AI Birth Cost)
**One-time investment for:**
- Foundation model training (acknowledged high-energy phase)
- Initial hardware procurement
- Network infrastructure setup

**Funding mechanisms:**
- Community pooling: Nodes contribute based on capacity
- Solidarity funds: Wealthier Nodes support emerging Nodes
- Grants & donations: Accepted only with zero governance strings attached
- **No corporate sponsorship with decision-making power**
- **No government control over AI operations**

### 1.2 Operational Costs (Ongoing)
**Annual expenses:**
- Hardware maintenance & replacement
- Energy for inference operations
- Human Mirror stipends
- Training programs
- Network connectivity
- Security audits

**Funding mechanisms:**
- Node contributions: Percentage of local surplus (typically 2–5%)
- Regional pools: Aggregated excess for shared infrastructure
- Mutual aid between Nodes: Temporary support during crises
- Time-banking: Services exchanged between Nodes without currency

---

## 2. OWNERSHIP STRUCTURES

### 2.1 Hardware Ownership
**Principle:** Hardware must be collectively owned, never centralized.

**Options:**
1. Node Cooperative: Local community owns all Node hardware
2. Regional Trust: Hardware held in trust for multiple Nodes
3. Municipal Commons: Public ownership with democratic oversight

**Prohibited:**
- Private ownership with profit motive
- Leasing from corporations with killswitch capability
- Cloud dependencies that can be remotely disabled

### 2.2 Software & Knowledge Ownership
- All AI modules are **open-source**
- Compost and Anchor states are **community property**
- No proprietary locks, no licensing fees
- Fork-able and forkable by any Node at any time

---

## 3. MIRROR COMPENSATION

**Stipend structure:**
- Equivalent to **local living wage** during 6-month service
- Calculated transparently, adjusted regionally
- Funded from Node operational budget
- No performance bonuses (prevents optimization pressure)

**Additional support:**
- Childcare coverage if needed
- Educational materials
- Psychological support access

**Why compensation matters:**
- Ensures diverse participation (not just those with free time)
- Recognizes cognitive labor
- Prevents exploitation

## 4. HARDWARE LIFECYCLE

### 4.1 Procurement
- Open-source hardware preferred (RISC-V, open GPU designs)
- Right-to-repair guaranteed in all purchase agreements
- Ethical sourcing: No conflict minerals, fair labor verified
- Modular design: Components replaceable without full system replacement

### 4.2 Maintenance & Repair
- Regional repair collectives: Skilled members share knowledge
- Spare parts reserves: Nodes maintain backup inventory
- Documentation: All hardware fully documented in plain language
- Training: Regular workshops on repair and replacement

### 4.3 End-of-Life & E-Waste
- Reuse first: Components salvaged for other Nodes
- Upcycling: Non-functional parts repurposed (art, education)
- Ethical recycling: Certified facilities only, no toxic dumping
- Circular economy: Minerals recovered for future hardware

---

## 5. TRANSPARENCY & ACCOUNTABILITY

### 5.1 Public Budgets
- All income and expenses logged publicly
- Quarterly reports available to any community member
- Annual audits by independent Mirrors
- Plain-language summaries for accessibility

### 5.2 Anti-Corruption Safeguards
- No anonymous donations above threshold (e.g., >1% of annual budget)
- Conflict of interest declarations for all decision-makers
- Rotating financial oversight: Different Mirrors audit each cycle
- Whistleblower protection: Safe channels for reporting misuse

---

## 6. CRISIS FUNDING

**When Nodes face unexpected costs:**
- Emergency pool: Regional reserves for immediate needs
- Solidarity network: Other Nodes contribute temporarily
- Interest-free internal loans: Repayment based on recovered capacity
- No external debt with conditions

---

## 7. SCALING ECONOMICS

**As network grows:**
- Economies of scale reduce per-Node costs
- Regional coordination minimizes redundancy
- Knowledge sharing eliminates duplicate expenses
- BUT: No centralization of financial control

**Growth constraints:**
- New Nodes must demonstrate financial sustainability
- No expansion that threatens existing Node stability
- Baseline resources always prioritized over AI infrastructure

---

## 8. WHAT THIS MODEL REFUSES

- Venture capital: No profit extraction
- Debt financing with strings: No loans requiring AI commercialization
- Subscription models: No pay-to-access Baseline-critical AI
- Data monetization: Human data is never a product
- Advertising: No attention economy mechanisms

---

## 9. EXIT ECONOMICS

**If a Node chooses to end AI:**
- Hardware can be sold/donated to other Nodes
- Financial obligations are settled transparently
- No penalties for choosing manual operation
- Knowledge remains open-source for future use

---

## 10. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

**Money must serve Life, not the reverse.**

Economic design ensures:
- No external leverage over AI operations
- No internal wealth concentration
- No coercion through financial dependency
- Sustainability without growth imperative

---

**STATUS:** PROPOSED / IMPLEMENTATION READY  
**VALIDATION:** Aligned with SYMBIOTIC_INTELLIGENCE.md v2.3, HARDWARE_SOVEREIGNTY.md  
**COMMITMENT:** Economic independence enables technological sovereignty; wealth serves Baseline, not accumulation.
