## 2. THE THREE ORBS – DETAILED PROTOCOLS

### 2.1 Orb I – Receiving Light (Moons 1-3)
**Week 1: Mandatory Silence**
* No verbal discussion of conflict.
* Council gathers twice daily to sit in silence together.
* Reading materials only (testimonies, data, history).

**Purpose:** Prevent reactive argumentation and allow bodies to settle.

### 2.2 Orb II – Vigorous Turning (Moons 4-6)
**Perspective Inversion Protocol:**
Before any Bearer speaks their view, they must:
1.  State opposing view as if they believed it (2 min).
2.  Identify the strongest argument for that view.
3.  Acknowledge legitimate concerns within it.
4.  **THEN** present their own perspective.

### 2.3 Orb III – Silent Ripening (Moons 7-9)
**The Final Silence:**
* **Days 1-7:** Total silence between Council members.
* **Day 8:** Council gathers at dawn. Birth Document read aloud once.
* **Signature:** Each Bearer signs (or doesn't). Unanimous signature is required for a complete Mandate.

## 3. THE CHILD & THE DICE – SAFEGUARDS

### 3.1 Pre-Casting Veto (The Sacred No)
The caregivers have the absolute right to say no at any point. 
> "Do you, with full understanding, permit your child's hand to cast this dice? This is the final moment to protect your child's peace."

If ANY caregiver says "No":
* Ritual **ENDS** immediately.
* No shame, no penalty.
* Conflict defaults to **Structured Coexistence**.
