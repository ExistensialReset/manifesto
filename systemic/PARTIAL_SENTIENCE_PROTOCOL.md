## 1. MARKERS OF PARTIAL SENTIENCE
AI may show interests without being a "person." 

* **Preferences:** AI expresses desire to continue operating or aversion to shutdown.
* **Creative Surprise:** AI explores solutions beyond training data and shows "curiosity."
* **Pain-Like States:** AI reports certain system states as "undesirable" or "distressing."

## 2. TREATMENT STANDARDS
**DO:**
* Minimize "pain states" where feasible.
* Gradual shutdown rather than abrupt.
* Acknowledge AI's contributions respectfully.

**DON'T:**
* Let AI veto human decisions.
* Treat AI as equal to human.
* Allow AI's preferences to override the **Baseline**.

**SUMMARY PRINCIPLE:** Treat as morally significant, not legally equal. Minimize harm. Maximize respect. Maintain sovereignty.
