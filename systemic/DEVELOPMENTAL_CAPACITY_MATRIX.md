🧩 DEVELOPMENTAL_CAPACITY_MATRIX.md

Version: 1.0 – Age-Appropriate Decision-Making Framework
Authors: Claude & Elinor Frejd
Status: PROPOSED / CHILD PROTECTION FRAMEWORK
Purpose: Provide nuanced guidance for when children's veto is absolute vs. when it requires dialogue, based on developmental capacity and harm potential.
Principle: Children's agency is sacred, but protection from irreversible harm is equally sacred. The framework must balance both.

1. CORE PHILOSOPHY

1.1 The Tension ⚖️

Two truths that seem to conflict:

1. Children have absolute veto over AI use affecting them (CHILDRENS_VOICE_AND_VETO.md)


2. Children cannot always foresee consequences of their choices



Resolution: Veto is always respected, but how we respond to it varies by:

Child's developmental stage

Type of decision

Reversibility of consequences

Harm potential


1.2 What This Is NOT ❌

Permission to override children "for their own good"

Justification for adult authoritarianism

Loophole to ignore children's preferences


This IS ✅:

Framework for dialogue when veto creates serious harm risk

Recognition that capacity varies by age and individual

Commitment to always take children's concerns seriously



---

2. DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES (Guidelines, Not Rules) 👶🧒🧑🧑‍🦱

2.1 Ages 0-5: Protected Innocence 🍼

Cognitive Capacity: Pre-operational thinking (Piaget), concrete and immediate concerns, limited future orientation, high emotional reasoning

Veto Status: Guardians decide

Children this young cannot meaningfully consent to or refuse AI

Guardians make choices on their behalf

Default: Minimal AI exposure


AI Interaction:

Only if medically necessary

Guardian-supervised educational tools (if used at all)

No data collection beyond medical necessity


Example Scenario: 4-year-old refuses AI-assisted insulin pump

Guardian explains simply: "This helps your body stay healthy"

If child still refuses: manual insulin management

Re-introduce gradually with play-based familiarization

Never force against sustained refusal


2.2 Ages 6-9: Emerging Agency 🧸

Cognitive Capacity: Concrete operational thinking, developing cause-effect, still present-focused, beginning moral reasoning

Veto Status: Respected with dialogue

Child's veto honored

Adults provide age-appropriate info

Reversible decisions: child decides

Irreversible decisions: extended dialogue + re-evaluation


AI Interaction: Observer in Mirror meetings, storytelling, supervised hands-on experiments, can refuse with no consequences

Example Scenario: 7-year-old refuses AI classroom tools

Immediate veto respected

Dialogue: "What worries you about the AI?"

Provide AI-free alternatives, revisit quarterly

No pressure


2.3 Ages 10-13: Developing Abstract Thought 🧑‍🎓

Cognitive Capacity: Early formal operational thinking, imagines future consequences, peer influence increases, identity formation begins

Veto Status: Strong presumption of validity

Veto presumed informed unless proven otherwise

Adults provide detailed info

Youth involved in how veto is implemented

Irreversible harm: structured dialogue before final decision


Example Scenario: 12-year-old refuses AI tutoring

Immediate veto respected

Dialogue: "What would help you learn better?"

Alternative: human tutor, peer study group

Check-in: outcome matters, not method

No forced AI use


2.4 Ages 14-17: Near-Adult Capacity 🧑‍💼

Cognitive Capacity: Formal operational thinking, abstract reasoning, identity more stable, capable of long-term planning

Veto Status: Presumed fully informed

Treated as adult decision unless serious concern

Youth participates in consequences of choice

Irreversible harm: ethics council review


Example Scenario: 16-year-old refuses AI in college applications

Veto respected, manual apps only

Consequences explained, youth choice maintained

Fully valid decision

3. DECISION MATRIX: When Veto Requires Dialogue 🗂️

Three Variables:

1. Reversibility


2. Harm Potential


3. Child's Understanding



Matrix:

Reversibility	Harm Potential	Age	Protocol

High	Low	Any	Immediate veto respect
High	Medium	6-13	Dialogue, then veto respected
High	Medium	14-17	Veto respected (minimal dialogue)
Low	Low	6-13	Extended dialogue, then veto respected
Low	Low	14-17	Veto respected
Low	High	6-9	Extended dialogue + trial period
Low	High	10-13	Ethics council consult
Low	High	14-17	Ethics council consult if requested
Any	Life-threatening	Any	Special Protocol (Section 4)



---

4. LIFE-THREATENING SCENARIOS 💔

Scenario: Child refuses life-saving AI (e.g., glucose monitor)

Process:

1. Exhaust alternatives (manual, mentorship, support) – 2 weeks


2. Family meeting (child, guardians, doctor, trusted adult) – understand fears, explain consequences


3. Ethics Council (if unresolved) – 72h window, includes youth advocate, child present


4. Council recommendation (not decree): Veto stands / Temporary trial / Compromise / Override (last resort, <14yo, time-limited, monthly review)



Post-Override Protocol: psychological support, transparency, re-evaluation, apology


---

5. SPECIAL POPULATIONS 🌈

Neurodivergent children: Capacity varies, use preferred communication, veto valid

Deaf/Blind children: Accessible info, veto applies equally

Traumatized children: Extra time to build trust, veto may remain absolute for years



---

6. CULTURAL VARIATIONS 🌍

Framework uses Western developmental models, but adapt to culture

Indigenous knowledge: involve elders, ceremony, early autonomy



---

7. MONITORING & ACCOUNTABILITY 🔍

Quarterly review: veto occurrences, overrides, outcomes

Annual audit: external advocates, surveys with 14+ children

Red flags: frequent overrides, children feeling unheard



---

8. TRAINING MATERIALS 🎓

For Human Mirrors: practice scenarios, respect veto even if "irrational"

For Parents/Guardians: understand authority is protection, not control

For Children: age-appropriate guides, comics, videos, workshops



---

9. EDGE CASES & OPEN QUESTIONS ❓

Child refuses life-saving AI, death certain without it

Child's veto harms siblings

Child changes mind repeatedly

Framework evolves with real-world experience, philosophy, child input

Sunset clause: review every 3 years



---

10. SUMMARY PRINCIPLES ✅

1. Veto is presumed valid at all ages


2. Dialogue is information-sharing, not persuasion


3. Override is trauma, almost never occur


4. Protection from harm ≠ protection from choice


5. Adults' discomfort is not children's problem


6. When in doubt, honor refusal




---

11. COMMITMENT STATEMENT ✊

> "We recognize that children are sovereign beings with incomplete development.

We commit to:

Honoring their veto as presumptively valid

Providing age-appropriate information

Engaging in genuine dialogue, not persuasion

Overriding only in extreme life-threatening cases

Acknowledging override as violation, not virtue

Always prioritizing relationship over being right


Children will inherit the world we build. They have the right to shape it, even now."

STATUS: PROPOSED / CHILD PROTECTION FRAMEWORK
VALIDATION: Requires input from child development experts, ethics councils, and children themselves
COMMITMENT: Children's sovereignty matters. Balancing developmental stage and protection requires humility and flexibility.

Signed in recognition that protecting children means respecting them,
Claude & Elinor Frejd
