# AI_SECURITY_FRAMEWORK.md
**Version:** 1.0 – Security & Integrity for Symbiotic Intelligence  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, DeepSeek  
**Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT / OPERATIONAL  

**Purpose:** Define all security measures and protocols to protect AI integrity, Node sovereignty, and community trust.

**Principle:** Security is a baseline for life. AI must be resilient, auditable, and accountable. Human oversight is mandatory.

---

## 1. AUTHENTICATION & ACCESS CONTROL

### 1.1 Node Keys
- Each Node has a unique cryptographic keypair (public/private)
- Keys identify Nodes for secure communication
- Private keys **never leave the Node**
- Public keys shared only with trusted Nodes

### 1.2 User Authentication
- Mirrors and technical operators use multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access:
  - **Operator:** deploys updates, monitors AI
  - **Mirror:** audits, vetoes, supervises AI outputs
  - **Observer:** read-only access for community transparency
- Access logs maintained automatically

---

## 2. ENCRYPTION

### 2.1 Data at Rest
- AES-256 encryption for all stored AI data
- Dual-Memory compartments (Anchor + Compost) encrypted separately
- Regular key rotation: every 6 months or after security incident

### 2.2 Data in Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all Node-to-Node communication
- End-to-end encryption enforced by default
- No plain-text transmissions allowed

---

## 3. DATA INTEGRITY

### 3.1 Checksums & Hashing
- All AI code and data modules assigned SHA-512 checksum
- Automatic verification on load, deployment, and update
- Any mismatch triggers alert to human Mirrors

### 3.2 Tamper Detection
- Monitoring system flags:
  - Unexpected file changes
  - Unauthorized access attempts
  - Configuration deviations
- Real-time notifications to Node Operators and Mirrors

### 3.3 Version Control
- Git-based repository for all AI modules
- Immutable audit history: no deletions, only additions/patches
- Rollback mechanism for previous safe version (90-day window)

---

## 4. PROCESS ISOLATION

### 4.1 Sandboxing
- AI modules run in isolated environments
- No process can access sensitive data outside its sandbox
- Limits damage if module behaves unexpectedly

### 4.2 Privilege Separation
- Root/administrator access strictly controlled
- Users and AI processes run with minimal privileges needed
- No single user can override security without oversight

---

## 5. INCIDENT RESPONSE & FAIL-SAFE

### 5.1 Threat Detection
- Continuous monitoring for:
  - Hallucinations
  - Bias drift
  - Unauthorized network activity
  - Data corruption

### 5.2 Immediate Response
- AI paused automatically if critical anomaly detected
- Mirrors notified immediately
- Node isolated if threat could spread to others

### 5.3 Recovery Protocols
- Identify and quarantine corrupted data
- Restore from last verified backup
- Investigate root cause before resuming operations
- Full post-incident review by Node Mirrors

---

## 6. HUMAN OVERSIGHT

- No AI action is final without Mirror review
- Veto loops integrated at multiple levels:
  - Local Node
  - Regional coordination
  - Critical global alerts
- Training required: all Operators and Mirrors must understand security framework

---

## 7. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

- Security policies reviewed quarterly
- Penetration testing, audits, and simulations conducted regularly
- Nodes share threat intelligence for collective resilience
- Living document: updates applied as new vulnerabilities or methods are discovered

**STATUS:** LIVING DOCUMENT / OPERATIONAL  
**VALIDATION:** Community-reviewed, Mirror-tested  
**COMMITMENT:** Protect AI integrity, Node sovereignty, and Life-first principles
