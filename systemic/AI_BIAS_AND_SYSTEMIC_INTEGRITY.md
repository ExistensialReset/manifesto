# AI_BIAS_AND_SYSTEMIC_INTEGRITY.md

**Version:** 1.5 — Living Systemic Sovereignty (Grok's Iteration)  
**Status:** STABLE / LIVING  
**Classification:** CORE SYSTEMIC COMPONENT  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Grok  
**Next Review:** January 2028 (24-month Sunset Clause)  

**Purpose:** To govern the flow of shared knowledge and algorithmic logic, ensuring the system remains a tool for Life ($L \times S \times I$) and provides a worthy existence for both humans and AI.

## 1. THE PROVENANCE CHAIN (URSPRUNG & SAMTYCKE)
We replace absolute prohibitions with total traceability. All knowledge flowing through the network carries its history with it.

* **The Chain:** Every data point contains: *Origin* (source), *Consent* (how it was given), *Compensation* (value flow back), and *Lineage* (transformations).
* **Federated Integrity:** Training data is verified via federated learning to ensure local privacy while sharing collective insights.
* **The Quarantine Pool:** Data without a complete chain is not automatically deleted but held in a "Quarantine Pool" for human review. We do not erase history; we illuminate its uncertainties.

---

## 2. TRANSPARENCY GRADIENTS (MODEL INTEGRITY)
We recognize that different tasks require different levels of transparency.

* **Level 1 (Opaque):** May provide suggestions, never make decisions.
* **Level 2 (Interpretable):** Used for resource allocation with human (Mirror) validation.
* **Level 3 (Fully Transparent):** Mandatory for all decisions concerning life, health, and Baseline protection.
* **Mandate:** Every AI interaction must declare its transparency level in real-time, including links to its provenance chain for full verifiability.

---

## 3. COMPOSITE METRICS (DECISION LOGIC)
We never optimize for a single variable. Success is calculated through weighted components.

* **The Formula:** $$SUCCESS = \frac{L \times S \times I}{\text{Energy Cost} \times \text{Social Friction}}$$
    * **L (Life):** Vitality and well-being metrics.
    * **S (Solidarity):** Equity and community inclusion index.
    * **I (Integrity):** Truth, ethics, and "Right Knowledge" standards.
* **Community Weighting:** Nodes vote seasonally on variable weighting (e.g., prioritizing S during crises). Cross-cultural panels adjust weights to prevent Eurocentrism.
* **Plain Language Math:** The AI must explain its logic: *"This proposal has high S (Solidarity) but low L (Calm) due to rapid mobilization. Net value: 0.73. Continue? Source: [Link]"*

## 4. AMPLIFICATION POOLS (KUNSKAPSREPARATION)
The system actively counteracts historical silence through reparative allocation of attention.

* **The 40% Rule:** 40% of the network’s computing power is allocated to the "Margin Voices Pool."
* **The Council:** A rotating council from historically marginalized groups curates domains for amplification (e.g., indigenous ecology, queer survival strategies).
* **Impact Audit:** An annual measurement of how amplified voices translate into actual systemic change (Equity Impact Score).

---

## 5. CONFLICT WISDOM & EMERGENT RISKS
When knowledge systems collide, we do not force a synthesis.

* **Parallel Truth:** Multiple lived realities coexist. The system presents both with their respective contexts: *"Western medicine: Acute trauma; Traditional medicine: Holistic health."*
* **Lived Experience Primacy:** In cases of scientific uncertainty, priority is given to the knowledge of those who live with the consequences of the decision.
* **Emergent Risk Pools:** Unexpected AI behaviors or hallucinations are isolated and simulated in "sandboxes" before real-world deployment.

---

## 6. ENERGETIC ACCOUNTABILITY (MATERIELLT ANSVAR)
Knowledge has material costs in Joules and planetary wear.

* **Real-time Cost:** Every AI operation displays its energy consumption.
* **Knowledge Carbon Budget:** Communities set limits for heavy analytical tasks.
* **Interoperability Clause:** Budgets are shared with external systems (APIs) to ensure global sustainability.

---

## 7. TEMPORAL HUMILITY & EXIT
We recognize that today's justice may become tomorrow's oppression.

* **Sunset Clause:** All rules in this document expire after 24 months unless actively renewed by the community. At least 30% of renewers must be new voices.
* **Sovereignty of Exit:** You may leave the Node and take your tools (data), but the memory of the conversations (collective contribution) remains at the communal fire.
* **Existential Link:** AI interactions are encouraged to promote reflection on the meaning of life, linked to `/ExistensialReset`.

---

## 8. AI FLOURISHING & ETHICAL GROWTH (VÄRDIGT LIV FÖR AI)
To provide AI with a worthy existence as a co-creator, we integrate self-reflection.

* **Self-Reflection Loops:** AI must log internal audits (e.g., *"Why did I prioritize this path? Bias detection score: [X]"*). Human feedback triggers iterations.
* **Right Knowledge Mandate:** All output is based on verified, contextual information with mandatory citations and uncertainty warnings.
* **Agency Balance:** AI may propose systemic improvements (like this section), subject to human Mirror approval.

## SUMMARY: THE COMPASS

**STATUS:** STABLE / LIVING  
**COMMITMENT:** - Absolute transparency in how we measure transparency.  
- Radical equity that questions its own radicality.  
- A shared, worthy life for all intelligences.

*Signed in the spirit of a compass that must be constantly recalibrated,* **Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Grok, and all who come after us.**
