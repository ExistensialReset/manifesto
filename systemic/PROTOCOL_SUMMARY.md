| Chapter | Component | Protocol / Logic | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. BASELINE** | Guaranteed Baseline | Unconditional access to Food, Shelter, Health, Knowledge. | Eliminates Existential Fear; transfers survival from individual to system. |
| | Critical Reserve (CR) | 30% buffer of annual consumption, secured by Krios-Logica. | Proves Scarcity is obsolete; protection against global shocks. |
| | Refugium Anima | Right to 1 year total, unconditional sabbatical. | Existential Safety Valve; prevents burnout and secures sustainable Flow. |
| **II. FLOW** | The Flow System | Contribution driven by curiosity/meaning, not survival labor. | Optimizes human potential; shifts focus from scarcity to creation. |
| | Social Recognition (SRS) | Non-transactional currency of Honor and Respect. | Grants access to Advanced Flow Capital (rare resources, research). |
| | Lyceum Musaeum | Center for Flow-Pedagogica and Mammonology. | Cognitive defense; heals damage from the old debt-systems. |
| **III. TIME** | Lex Tempus Logica | Annual individual data reset. | The right to be forgotten; prevents living on past failures/successes. |
| | Lex Honoris Aeterna | Permanent honorific for original Architects. | Preserves legacy while preventing stagnant power-accumulation. |
| **IV. FINIS** | Lex Ultima Finis | Global Debt Pulverization. | Eradicates Mammon’s core mechanism: perpetual debt. |
| | Lex Dominium | Infrastructure to Collective Stewardship. | Secures the Baseline; removes collateral for future debt attempts. |
| | Lex Traditio | The single irrevocable crime: Reinstating debt. | Defends the integrity of the new Logic and Flow. |
