## 1. PURPOSE (The "Why")
FLOW_SRS defines how resources—time, energy, materials, and attention—move within and between Nodes. It replaces the Mammon-logic of accumulation with the life-centric logic of circulation.

> *"Resources are like water; they give life when they flow, but become toxic when they stagnate."*

**Core Goals:**
* **Baseline Security:** Guaranteed access to survival and creative tools.
* **Flow-Driven Contribution:** Labor born from inspiration, not coercion.
* **Luxury Allocation:** Fair distribution of unique resources via SRS and Sigma-Flow.
* **Systemic Integrity:** Automated protection via Lex Finis and RTC-Guardians.

## 2. CORE MECHANISMS

### 2.1 Systemic Resonance (Utility for the Whole)
~80% of collective resources flow toward network healing and maintenance.
* **Trigger:** STRESS_INDEX (Ref: `Symbiotic Intelligence Node 1.6`).
* **Goal:** Minimize suffering, maximize the ecological and social baseline (**L-Calm**).

### 2.2 Sigma-Flow (Spontaneity)
~20% of resources are protected for pure creativity and exploration.
* **Method:** Allocated via **Entropic Shuffle** (Ref: `TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md §1`).
* **Goal:** Create space for unexpected, beautiful, and illogical contributions (**S-Spontaneity**).

### 2.3 RTC-Guardian (Regeneration Time Constant)
* **Rule:** Matches resource flows against natural recovery times.
* **Lex Finis:** Negative RTC triggers an automatic system veto.

### 2.4 Triad AI Workflow
| Role | Responsibility | Interaction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Visionary AI** | Suggests flows and allocations | Proposals -> Grounding AI |
| **Grounding AI** | Validates feasibility and LSI alignment | Returns annotated proposals |
| **Meta-AI** | Monitors Lex Finis and systemic drift | Alerts Human Mirrors |

## 3. ALLOCATION OF LUXURY RESOURCES
*Luxury resources are unique by nature (time, place, personhood), not by artificial scarcity.*

### 3.1 Social Recognition Score (SRS)
A non-coercive reflection of contribution, used **only** for luxury allocation.
* **Dimensions:** 
    * **L (Labor):** Logistical work.  
    * **S (Support):** Emotional/relational labor.  
    * **I (Initiative):** Creative leadership.  
    * **X (Extraordinary):** Crisis management or major donations.
* **Formula:** $SRS = L + S + I + X$
* **Decay:** Natural half-life of 1-3 months to prevent permanent elites.

### 3.2 Pay-It-Forward
SRS priority can be redirected to others. This neutralizes status fixation and rewards generosity as a high-value contribution.

## 4. SAFEGUARDS & RED LINES

### 4.1 The Baseline Shield
**NEVER AFFECTED BY SRS:**
* Food, shelter, healthcare, and internet.
* **All Creative Tools:** Studios, workshops, instruments, and materials.
* *If a tool is scarce, the solution is to provide more tools, not to ration them.*

### 4.2 The Uncertainty Protocol
1.  **Stillness-Exit:** Pause all processing if friction is too high (Ref: `TECH_SPEC §3`).
2.  **Human Mirror Consultation:** Elevate the decision to somatic/human intuition.
3.  **Prototyping:** Small-scale, 100% reversible testing.

## 5. METRICS & KPIS

| Metric | Target | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flow Integrity Index** | ≥ 95% | Minimize data loss or corruption |
| **Alignment Score** | ≥ 0.9 | Ensure flows serve life-aligned goals |
| **Node Redundancy** | ≥ 2 | Prevent single-point failures |
| **Somatic Blindness** | 0.0 | Ensure all RTC data is locally verified |

## 6. PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

✅ **RIGHT (Luxury/SRS):**
* Priority for a 1-week masterclass with a specific mentor.
* A residency in a unique, limited-capacity location.
* Access to rare, high-energy research equipment.

❌ **WRONG (Baseline/Non-SRS):**
* Requiring "points" to enter the communal pottery studio.
* Using SRS to determine who gets art supplies.
* Limiting maker-space hours based on contribution scores.
