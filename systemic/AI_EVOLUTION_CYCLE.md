# AI_EVOLUTION_CYCLE.md
**Version:** 1.0 – Evolutionary Cycle for Symbiotic Intelligence  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, DeepSeek  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL / SYSTEMIC FRAMEWORK  

**Purpose:** Define the structured, seasonal process for AI updates, preventing Mammon-drift, preserving Baseline, and ensuring human oversight at every stage.  

**Principle:** Slow, deliberate evolution of AI maintains control, prevents drift, and strengthens resilience. Human Mirrors are active participants; AI is never autonomous in updating itself.

## 1. FIVE-PHASE SEASONAL CYCLE

### 1.1 Observation Phase (Winter)
**Duration:** 4–6 weeks  
**Purpose:** Gather accurate data and monitor AI outputs.  
**Activities:**
- Record anomalies, performance, and user feedback
- Document successes and failures in Compost
- Maintain strict Baseline protection; no experimental changes

**Human Oversight:**
- Mirrors review data weekly
- Identify emerging risks or inefficiencies
- Compile report for next phase

---

### 1.2 Compost Phase (Spring)
**Duration:** 4–6 weeks  
**Purpose:** Process new observations and lessons learned.  
**Activities:**
- Integrate relevant insights into the AI’s adaptive memory
- Test small-scale adjustments in sandbox environments
- Validate ethical alignment and developmental appropriateness

**Human Oversight:**
- Mirrors approve or veto each proposed change
- Document all tests and outcomes
- Prepare recommendation for Audit Phase

---

### 1.3 Audit Phase (Summer)
**Duration:** 2–4 weeks  
**Purpose:** Formal review of proposed AI changes before integration.  
**Activities:**
- Verify correctness, safety, and Baseline compliance
- Ensure any bias, hallucination, or error trends are addressed
- Confirm changes respect children, elders, and marginalized voices

**Human Oversight:**
- Mirrors perform detailed checks
- External auditors (optional) may be consulted
- Only approved changes advance to Integration Phase

---

### 1.4 Integration Phase (Autumn)
**Duration:** 2–4 weeks  
**Purpose:** Deploy approved changes to live AI systems.  
**Activities:**
- Gradual rollout to Local Nodes, with logging and monitoring
- Backup existing systems for rollback if needed
- Confirm alignment with global ethical standards and local customs

**Human Oversight:**
- Mirrors supervise rollout
- Real-time error detection
- Immediate rollback possible if Baseline or safety compromised

---

### 1.5 Fast Phase (Post-Integration)
**Duration:** 1–2 weeks (or scheduled AI-Fast)  
**Purpose:** Pause AI activity to allow human skills, manual systems, and critical reflection.  
**Activities:**
- AI is turned off or limited to inference-only, non-critical tasks
- Community members perform manual operations
- Observe for reliance on AI and adjust training/education accordingly

**Human Oversight:**
- Mirrors document findings
- Lessons feed into next Observation Phase
- Reinforces human sovereignty and prevents overreliance

## 2. GUIDELINES FOR AI EVOLUTION

### 2.1 Preventing Mammon-Drift
- All changes must be justified for life support, human agency, or community wellbeing
- Reject updates aimed at efficiency, growth, or optimization for profit
- Use Life Formula (L × S × I) as a guiding metric

### 2.2 Transparency & Documentation
- Every observation, test, audit, and integration must be logged in Dual-Memory (Anchor + Compost)
- Public summaries shared with Node communities
- Mirrors accountable for all approvals

### 2.3 Reversibility
- Every integration has a 90-day rollback window
- Historical versions archived
- Emergency rollback if Baseline threatened

### 2.4 Human-Centric Updates
- AI cannot initiate self-updates
- All modifications must pass through human Mirrors
- Special attention to children, elders, and vulnerable populations

### 2.5 Seasonal Alignment
- Align phases with local climate and cultural cycles where possible
- Flexibility in duration permitted, but sequence must remain intact
- Fast Phase encourages reflection and reduces dependency

## 3. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

> “AI evolves slowly, under watchful human eyes, guided by ethics, and aligned to life. Speed is tempting; patience is power.”  

- Observation → Compost → Audit → Integration → Fast  
- Mirrors govern every stage  
- Baseline inviolable, Buffer carefully monitored  
- Lessons feed into next cycle

**STATUS:** ACTIVE / SYSTEMIC FRAMEWORK  
**VALIDATION:** Aligned with SYMBIOTIC_INTELLIGENCE.md v2.3, AI_SAFETY_PROTOCOL.md  
**COMMITMENT:** Preserve human sovereignty, prevent Mammon-drift, ensure life-centric evolution.
