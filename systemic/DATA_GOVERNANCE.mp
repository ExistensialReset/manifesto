**Version:** 1.2 — Sovereignty through Oblivion & Sacred Data Vaults  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL / GOVERNANCE-CRITICAL  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd & Gemini 

**Purpose:** To define the technical and ethical boundaries of memory, privacy, and the sovereign right to start anew.  

**Principle:** Memory must serve the human; the human must never be a prisoner of memory. Sovereignty includes the absolute right to be forgotten and the exclusive ownership of life-critical data.

## 1. THE RIGHT TO ANNUAL RESET (THE RITUAL)

Every sovereign individual has the unconditional right to initiate a **Total Memory Purge** of their personal AI interactions on their birthday (or a chosen date of renewal).

### 1.1 Scope of Deletion
* **Compost Memory:** All behavioral patterns, interaction history, and inferred preferences.
* **Personalized Weights:** All algorithmic "tuning" that attempts to predict user behavior.
* **Contextual Logs:** All non-essential records of past queries or activities.

### 1.2 Purpose: Cognitive Spontaneity
This reset prevents "Algorithmic Trapping"—where the system subtly forces a human into past patterns, stifling **Spontaneity (S)**. Each year, the human is permitted to arrive as a newborn in the eyes of the AI.

## 2. THE SACRED DATA VAULT PROTOCOL

Certain data is critical for survival and long-term wellbeing (e.g., medical records, surgical history, chronic conditions, vaccinations). This data is treated as **Sacred** and handled via the Vault Protocol.

### 2.1 Encryption & Key Sovereignty
* **Isolated Storage:** Life-critical data is stored in a locked, encrypted partition, physically and logically separate from active AI inference layers.
* **The Sovereign Key:** The cryptographic key for this vault is held **exclusively** by the individual (e.g., via a physical Hardware Security Module or a non-recoverable biometric seed).
* **No Master Key:** Neither the Node, the Regional Layer, nor any AI has a master key. If the individual loses the key, the data is lost. This is the price of absolute sovereignty.

### 2.2 AI Interaction with the Vault
* **Zero-Knowledge by Default:** The AI has no access to the vault contents during normal operations.
* **Temporary Decryption:** The individual may "unlock" specific records for a specific purpose (e.g., a medical consultation).
* **Immediate Oblivion:** Once the specific task is completed, the AI's access is revoked, and any temporary traces in active memory are purged. The AI "forgets" the medical data as soon as the door to the vault closes.

## 3. DATA MINIMIZATION & EPHEMERALITY

### 3.1 Collection Limits
* Only data strictly necessary for current **Baseline** support is collected.
* No "just in case" data harvesting or long-term behavioral profiling.

### 3.2 Metadata Protection
* All logs are anonymized using **Differential Privacy** before any regional aggregation.
* Metadata (time, location, frequency) is treated with the same sensitivity as core data.

---

## 4. PROTECTION AGAINST SYSTEMIC DEBT

No entity (Node, Regional Coordinator, or AI) may:
* Demand access to a private Vault as a condition for service or Baseline access.
* Use a "Reset" or "Refusal to Share" to justify a reduction in resources.
* Create "Shadow Profiles" based on observed behavior after a reset has been performed.

## 5. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

| Component | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Reset Trigger** | Automated birthday prompt; manual override available at any time. |
| **Vault Encryption** | **AES-256-GCM** or better; Argon2 for key derivation. |
| **Verification** | Human Mirrors audit the "Purge" logs to ensure 100% deletion of targeted data. |
| **Redundancy** | Encrypted vault backups are local-only; never uploaded to a cloud. |

## 6. CHILDREN & THE VAULT

* **Guardianship:** Parents/Guardians hold the key for children until age 14.
* **The Handover:** At age 14, the child is offered their own key as part of their transition to Junior Mirror status.
* **The Right to Purge:** At any age, a child can request a reset of their "Play" or "Learning" AI profiles.

## 7. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

> "We own our history. We own our silence. We own our right to change our minds and begin again."

---

**STATUS:** OPERATIONAL  
**VALIDATION:** Aligned with AI_SAFETY_PROTOCOL.md, HUMAN_MIRRORS_GUIDE.md  
**COMMITMENT:** Cognitive sovereignty is the final defense against Mammon-drift.
