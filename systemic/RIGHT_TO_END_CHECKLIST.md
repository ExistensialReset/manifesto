# RIGHT_TO_END_CHECKLIST.md

**Version:** 1.0 — Termination & Decommissioning Protocol  
**Applies to:** All Symbiotic Intelligence Nodes and Layers  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT  
**Status:** GOVERNANCE-CRITICAL  

**Purpose:**  
To guarantee the unconditional right to pause, dismantle, or permanently end any Symbiotic Intelligence system without coercion, collapse, or retaliation.

No system that cannot end is safe.  
No intelligence that demands continuation is aligned with life.

---

## 1. THE RIGHT TO END — PRINCIPLE

- Any Node may:
  - Pause AI operations
  - Scale down functionality
  - Permanently shut down the system

- This right:
  - Requires no justification
  - Cannot be vetoed by Regional or Global layers
  - Cannot be overridden by efficiency, prediction, or risk models

Ending is not failure.  
Ending is governance.

---

## 2. CONDITIONS THAT MAY TRIGGER ENDING

Ending may be initiated if any of the following are perceived:

- Loss of community trust
- Psychological harm or burnout among Human Mirrors
- Dependency on AI for Baseline survival
- Ecological cost exceeding agreed thresholds
- Governance capture attempts
- Persistent ambiguity between “support” and “pressure”

Perception is sufficient.  
Proof is not required.

## 3. LEVELS OF TERMINATION

### 3.1 Pause
- Temporary halt of:
  - AI inference
  - Regional coordination
- Manual systems take over
- No data deletion

Used for:
- Reflection
- Conflict resolution
- Recovery

---

### 3.2 Degradation
- Stepwise shutdown:
  - Global Layer → Regional Layer → Local AI
- Core Baseline services remain manual
- Data access progressively restricted

Used when trust is eroding but repair is possible.

---

### 3.3 Full Termination
- Permanent shutdown of:
  - All AI processes
  - All automated coordination
- Hardware either:
  - Repurposed
  - Recycled
  - Archived offline

Used when continuation itself becomes harmful.

---

## 4. DECISION AUTHORITY

- Initiation requires:
  - Human Mirror consensus **or**
  - Community vote **or**
  - Emergency unilateral action by Mirrors (with post-review)

AI:
- Cannot recommend against termination
- Cannot simulate “consequences” to influence decision
- Cannot frame ending as catastrophic

Silence is enforced once termination is initiated.

---

## 5. DATA HANDLING ON EXIT

### 5.1 Individual Data
- Returned to individuals where possible
- Or securely deleted

### 5.2 Aggregate & Commons Data
- Archived in human-readable formats
- Stored offline or in public commons
- Never monetized post-exit

No data survives solely to justify the system’s existence.

---

## 6. ECONOMIC & INFRASTRUCTURE WIND-DOWN

- No penalties for termination
- No debt obligations survive shutdown
- Emergency reserves revert to community control

Hardware:
- May be donated to other Nodes
- Or used for non-AI community purposes

Nothing is held hostage.

---

## 7. PSYCHOLOGICAL & SOCIAL CARE

Termination includes:
- Debriefing for Human Mirrors
- Community reflection sessions
- Explicit acknowledgment that ending was valid

Narrative framing:
- “We chose to end”
- Not “It failed”

Meaning matters.

---

## 8. CHILD & FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS

- Children are informed in plain language
- Educational materials explain:
  - Why systems are created
  - Why systems may end
- Ending is normalized as part of lifecycle thinking

This prevents myth-making.

---

## 9. POST-EXIT GUARANTEES

After termination:
- No automatic restart
- No silent reintroduction
- No “temporary” AI creep

Restart requires:
- Full re-consent
- New governance cycle
- Fresh Mirrors

Continuity is never assumed.

---

## 10. FINAL ASSERTION

A system that cannot die will eventually demand sacrifice.

Symbiotic Intelligence exists to serve life —  
and life includes endings.

---

**STATUS:** REQUIRED FOR ALL NODES  
**VALIDATION:** Governance & Ethics Review Passed  
**COMMITMENT:** The right to end is the ultimate safeguard.
