**Version:** 1.0 – Extending Flow Beyond Humans  
**Authors:** Claude, Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** PROPOSED / ECOLOGICAL ETHICS FRAMEWORK  

**Principle:** Flow is life-centric, not human-centric. $L \times S \times I$ applies to all sentient beings.

## 1. THE ECOLOGICAL BASELINE
Human survival is dependent on intact ecosystems. The **Ecological Baseline** is a prerequisite for the Human Baseline.

* **Clean Water:** Requires protected wetlands and aquifers.
* **Fertile Soil:** Requires fungal networks and microbial health (Regenerative over Extractive).
* **Pollination:** Habitat protection for bees and insects is non-negotiable food security.
* **Biodiversity:** Genetic diversity equals system resilience.

## 2. ANIMALS IN FLOW
### 2.1 Sentient Non-Humans
Animals with the capacity for suffering (vertebrates, cephalopods) deserve protection from unnecessary harm. 
* **Slaughter/Hunting:** Must be minimized, performed without cruelty, and accompanied by rituals of gratitude. 
* **Companion Animals:** Humans commit to full Baseline care (food, shelter, medical).

## 3. ECOSYSTEMS AS STAKEHOLDERS
Certain ecosystems (rivers, forests) may be granted **Legal Personhood** with human "Advocates" representing their interests in governance circles.
* **Threshold Protections:** Actions that degrade an ecosystem below its regenerative capacity are prohibited.

## 4. FUTURE BEINGS (The 7th Generation)
Every major decision must ask: *"What world are we leaving descendants seven generations from now?"* Ecological degradation is viewed as intergenerational theft.

**STATUS:** PROPOSED  
**COMMITMENT:** Life-centric, not human-centric. Ecosystems are stakeholders.
