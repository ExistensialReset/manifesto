# 🌿 INTERSPECIES_PROTOCOL.md (Calibrated Version)

**Version:** 1.1 – Dynamic Responsiveness and Ecological Integration  
**Authors:** Claude, Elinor Frejd & Gemini 
**Status:** ACTIVE ECOLOGICAL ETHICS FRAMEWORK  
**Principle:** Flow is life-centric. $L \times S \times I$ applies to all sentient beings. We listen more than we administer.

## 1. SCALABLE RESPONSIVENESS (Speed & Decision-Making)

To prevent stagnation and bureaucracy, interaction with the ecosystem is divided into three speeds:

* **Daily Flow (High Speed):** Care, maintenance, weeding, and harvesting require no consultation. The individual acting from a secure Baseline has the mandate. We trust the instinctive human impulse toward care.
* **Systemic Adjustment (Medium Speed):** Changes affecting the character of a place (e.g., minor construction or water management). This utilizes real-time data (Dashboard) and a brief round within the Circle. No Veto = Flow.
* **Vital Questions (Deep Time):** Only fundamental interventions or irreversible decisions activate extended timeframes (up to 9 Moons). This is a rare emergency brake to protect the Field.

## 2. THE LAND AS DASHBOARD (M-OS-R Integration)

Instead of relying solely on human interpretation, we use **Material Reality (M)** to guide us:
* **Bio-sensors:** Real-time data on biodiversity, water quality, and soil health act as the direct voice of the ecosystem.
* **Green Light:** If data shows stability and regenerative growth, the flow is confirmed.
* **Red Light:** If data shows stress, we stop. This is not a prohibition, but an invitation to silent observation.

## 3. MIRRORS OF THE LAND (Preventing Advocacy Tyranny)

The role of representing an ecosystem (Advocate/Ombud) is not a position of power, but of service:
* **Rotation:** The role is time-limited and rotates among Node members to prevent careerism or ideological capture.
* **Somatic Calibration:** Before an Advocate speaks for a place regarding a systemic issue, a period of silent presence (e.g., 72 hours) in the affected area is required.
* **Burden of Proof:** Human interpretation must never override the actual data from the Baseline without a profound Nine Moons process.

## 4. LEGAL STATUS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS

* **Ecological Personhood:** Critical ecosystems (rivers, forests) are recognized as stakeholders with a right to regenerative health.
* **The 7th Generation:** Every systemic decision is mirrored against the question: "Does this make the world safer for the children born 200 years from now?"
