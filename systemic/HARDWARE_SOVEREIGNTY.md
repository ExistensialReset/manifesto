HARDWARE_SOVEREIGNTY.md

Version: 1.1 – Material Independence for Symbiotic Intelligence
Authors: Elinor Frejd, Claude, ChatGPT 
Status: PROPOSED / TECHNICAL & POLITICAL SPECIFICATION

Purpose: Ensure Nodes control physical infrastructure completely, preventing external killswitches, dependency, or coercion through hardware. Provide operational guidance for energy, repair, redundancy, and education.

Principle: True AI sovereignty requires material sovereignty. Software freedom means nothing if hardware can be remotely disabled.

1. OWNERSHIP IMPERATIVES

1.1 Community Control

All hardware must be:

Owned by the Node collective (never individual, never corporate)

Physically located within Node territory

Accessible for inspection and repair by Mirrors

Free from remote killswitches or backdoors


1.2 Prohibited Dependencies

Nodes must NOT rely on:

Cloud services that can be revoked

Hardware with proprietary firmware that prevents modification

Subscription-based compute (AWS, Azure, etc.) for Baseline functions

Single-vendor lock-in (diversify suppliers)



---

2. HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS

2.1 Processor Architecture

Preferred:

RISC-V: Open-source instruction set, no vendor lock-in

ARM (with caution): Verify no hidden management engines

Avoid x86 when possible: Intel ME and AMD PSP are potential backdoors


Why this matters:

Closed processors can contain hidden features

Vendor can push firmware updates without consent

Open architectures allow full verification


2.2 Compute Hardware

For Local Nodes:

Edge devices: Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or equivalent

Low-power servers: <100W typical operation

Passive cooling preferred


For Regional Coordination:

Small server clusters (3-5 units for redundancy)

<500W total power budget

Modular design for piece-by-piece replacement


2.3 Storage

Encrypted local storage (AES-256 minimum)

Redundant drives (RAID or distributed backup)

No cloud-first architecture: Local-first always

Open firmware: Avoid drives with hidden features


2.4 Networking

Mesh networking capability: peer-to-peer communication

Fallback to local operation: Internet loss does not disable core functions

Open routers/switches: no proprietary management systems

Physical security: Network equipment secured against tampering



---

3. RIGHT TO REPAIR

3.1 Legal Framework

Full schematics and repair manuals

Access to replacement parts without vendor permission

Legal protection to modify hardware

Ability to fabricate simple components locally (3D printing, electronics)


3.2 Repair Collectives

Trained technicians rotate between Nodes

Knowledge shared openly (workshops, documentation)

Tool libraries maintained collectively

Spare parts pool maintained collectively


3.3 Documentation Standards

All hardware fully documented in plain language

Circuit diagrams available

Step-by-step replacement procedures

Troubleshooting guides for common failures



---

4. SUPPLY CHAIN ETHICS

4.1 Sourcing Principles

No conflict minerals

Fair labor practices

Environmental responsibility

Minimal shipping distance when possible


4.2 Vendor Relationships

Multiple suppliers for critical components

Long-term relationships with ethical vendors

Contracts forbid remote disablement or forced obsolescence

Open negotiation on pricing



---

5. E-WASTE & CIRCULAR ECONOMY

5.1 End-of-Life Planning

Attempt repair first

Salvage components

Upcycle creatively

Recycle responsibly


5.2 Design for Longevity

Repairable over disposable

Modular components

Standardized connectors

Avoid glued assemblies or soldered components


5.3 Material Recovery

Recover rare earth minerals

Plastics recycled into filament

Metals returned to supply chain

No toxic dumping



---

6. SECURITY AGAINST HARDWARE ATTACKS

6.1 Supply Chain Integrity

Trusted vendors only

Inspect hardware for tampering

Verify firmware checksums

Avoid used hardware from unknown sources


6.2 Physical Security

Access-controlled locations

Tamper-evident seals on critical components

Regular physical audits by Mirrors

Cameras/logs for server rooms (if culturally appropriate)


6.3 Firmware Security

Open-source firmware

Disable unnecessary features

Regular security audits of boot processes

Signed updates verified before installation



---

7. ENERGY SOVEREIGNTY

7.1 Power Sources

Renewable energy preferred (solar, wind, micro-hydro)

Local generation reduces grid dependency

Battery backup for continuity

Low-power design minimizes energy needs


7.2 Energy Monitoring

Real-time power consumption tracking

Transparent reporting to community

Efficiency improvements documented and shared

Integration with Node energy management



---

8. KNOWLEDGE SOVEREIGNTY

8.1 Technical Literacy

Workshops on hardware fundamentals

Children included in age-appropriate repair activities

Elders’ traditional knowledge integrated

No mystification of technology


8.2 Documentation

Hardware knowledge stored locally

Plain language alongside technical specs

Visual guides for non-readers

Oral tradition backups



---

9. DEPENDENCY AUDITS

Quarterly review of dependencies, repairability, alternatives, and single points of failure

Red flags: proprietary components, internet-reliant hardware, planned obsolescence



---

10. HARDWARE AS COMMONS

Collective ownership

Democratic decisions for upgrades/replacements

Hardware serves Baseline first

Future generations inherit maintainable systems



---

11. EDUCATION & CHILD ENGAGEMENT

Introduce children to basic repair concepts

Playful learning modules

Mentorship by adult Mirrors

Encourage curiosity, not fear of technology



---

12. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

Hardware must be:

Owned by the community

Understood fully

Repairable by Nodes

Sourced ethically

Recyclable responsibly


Without hardware sovereignty, software freedom is an illusion.
