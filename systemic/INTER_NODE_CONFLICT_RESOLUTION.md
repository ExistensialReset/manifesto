# INTER_NODE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md
**Version:** 1.1 – Dispute Mediation Between Nodes  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, DeepSeek  
**Status:** ACTIVE / GOVERNANCE SPECIFICATION  

**Purpose:** Establish fair, transparent processes for resolving conflicts between Nodes when resources are scarce, values diverge, or AI outputs create disagreement.

**Principle:** Conflict is inevitable; coercion is not. Nodes resolve disputes through dialogue, transparency, and mutual respect—never through force or centralized authority.

---

## 1. TYPES OF INTER-NODE CONFLICTS

### 1.1 Resource Competition
**Scenario:** Multiple Nodes need the same scarce resource.  
- Water during drought  
- Energy from limited local sources  
- Medical supplies (epidemic affecting multiple Nodes)  
- Food reserves (crop failures)

### 1.2 Ideological Divergence
**Scenario:** Nodes interpret Symbiotic Intelligence principles differently.  
- One Node wants more AI reliance; another wants less  
- Cultural practices conflict (e.g., child-rearing, community norms)  
- Environmental priorities differ (preservation vs. utilization)

### 1.3 AI Output Disagreement
**Scenario:** Regional AI suggests action one Node accepts, another rejects.  
- Surplus sharing proposal feels unfair  
- Predictive analysis disputes  
- Compost integration disagreements

### 1.4 Boundary Disputes
**Scenario:** Physical or governance boundaries unclear.  
- Shared watershed management  
- Overlapping foraging/hunting territories  
- Refugee/migration flows between Nodes

## 2. CONFLICT RESOLUTION PRINCIPLES

### 2.1 Core Values
**All resolution processes honor:**  
- **Baseline inviolability:** No Node's survival threatened  
- **Voluntary participation:** No forced arbitration  
- **Transparency:** All proceedings visible to both parties  
- **Cultural respect:** Different values acknowledged  
- **No winner/loser framing:** Seek mutual benefit or equitable compromise

### 2.2 Prohibited Methods
**Never acceptable:**  
- Violence or threat of violence  
- Economic coercion  
- AI manipulation  
- Majority tyranny  
- Shaming or public humiliation

---

## 3. RESOLUTION PROCESS (FIVE STAGES)

### 3.1 Stage 1: Direct Negotiation (Week 1-2)
**Node Mirrors meet directly:**  
- Present perspectives  
- AI provides neutral data (if relevant)  
- Seek voluntary agreement

**Possible outcomes:**  
- Consensus reached → conflict resolved  
- Partial agreement → defer to Stage 2  
- Impasse → proceed to mediation

---

### 3.2 Stage 2: Regional Mediation (Week 3-4)
**Neutral third-party Mirrors facilitate:**  
- Mirrors from uninvolved nearby Nodes  
- Cultural competence in both Nodes’ traditions

**Process:**  
1. Listening circle  
2. Clarification questions  
3. Reframing  
4. Proposal generation  
5. Selection

**Outcomes:**  
- Agreement → resolved  
- Temporary arrangement → revisit in 6 months  
- Continued impasse → proceed to Stage 3

---

### 3.3 Stage 3: Regional Council Review (Month 2)
**Broader Mirror assembly:**  
- Representatives from all Nodes in region  
- Recommendations non-binding  

**Outcomes:**  
- Recommendation accepted → resolved  
- Modified solution → adapt  
- Rejection → proceed to Stage 4

---

### 3.4 Stage 4: Temporal Separation (Month 3-12)
**Nodes agree to disagree temporarily:**  
- Freeze disputed resource use  
- Pause AI coordination  
- Maintain Baseline  
- Monthly check-ins

**After 12 months:**  
- Return to Stage 1 → attempt negotiation  
- Permanent divergence → Stage 5

---

### 3.5 Stage 5: Respectful Divergence (Permanent)
**If all stages fail:**  
- Nodes operate independently  
- Minimal contact (emergency aid only)  
- No hostility  
- Children taught divergence without demonization  

**Key commitment:** Baseline guaranteed for all, trust preserved as far as possible

---

### 3.6 Stage 6: Mandate of Nine Moons (Olöslig konflikt)
**If conflict är olöslig och alla andra steg misslyckas:**  
- Ritualiserad utväg enligt /principles  
- Neutral Mirrors aktiverar Mandate of Nine Moons  
- Målet: säkerställa Baseline och överleva utan konflikt  
- Beslut dokumenteras och arkiveras för framtida lärande  
- Respekt för kulturell och ideologisk autonomi prioriteras

---

## 4. RESOURCE ALLOCATION FRAMEWORKS

### 4.1 Proportional Need
- Calculate each Node's deficit from Baseline  
- Allocate proportionally to restore minimum viable levels  
- If insufficient → share equally

### 4.2 Rotational Access
- Alternate access periods for non-depleting resources

### 4.3 Lottery System
- Random selection if need indistinguishable  
- Transparent process, next-turn priority for "loser"

### 4.4 Historical Contribution
- Track surplus contributions  
- Priority given to Nodes with positive balance  
- Baseline never denied

---

## 5. AI'S ROLE IN CONFLICT

### 5.1 Neutral Data Provider
**AI can:**  
- Present historical patterns  
- Model outcomes  
- Translate cultural frameworks  

**AI cannot:**  
- Take sides  
- Enforce decisions  

### 5.2 Transparency Requirement
- All outputs visible  
- Humans interpret and decide

### 5.3 If AI is Source of Conflict
- Freeze AI recommendation  
- Human-only negotiation  
- Investigate bias/error  

---

## 6. CULTURAL MEDIATION

### 6.1 Cross-Cultural Conflicts
- Honor all cultures  
- Seek mutually acceptable solutions  
- If impossible → respectful divergence

### 6.2 Translator Mirrors
- Language and cultural fluency  
- Conflict de-escalation  
- Non-violent communication

---

## 7. CHILDREN & FUTURE GENERATIONS

### 7.1 Long-Term Impact Assessment
- Assess effect on children and precedent set  

### 7.2 Child Participation (Age-Appropriate)
- Youth Mirrors observe  
- Learn conflict resolution  
- Offer fresh perspectives

---

## 8. VIOLENCE PREVENTION

### 8.1 Early Warning Signs
- Escalating rhetoric  
- Resource hoarding  
- Isolation  
- Weapon acquisition

### 8.2 De-Escalation Protocols
- Immediate ceasefire  
- Peacekeeping Mirrors  
- Psychological support  
- Cooling-off period (≥30 days)

### 8.3 If Violence Occurs
- Humanitarian aid  
- Neutral investigation  
- Restorative accountability  
- Long-term reconciliation  
- Permanent separation if trust irrecoverable

---

## 9. EDGE CASES

### 9.1 Three-Way Conflicts
- Apply same principles  
- Complex mediation may be needed

### 9.2 Entire Regional Conflict
- Neutral mediators from distant regions  
- Advisory input from Global Observation Layer

### 9.3 Node vs. Regional Coordinator
- Regional Layer has no enforcement power  
- Node autonomy supersedes

---

## 10. DOCUMENTATION & LEARNING

### 10.1 Conflict Archives
- Document dispute, resolution, lessons learned  
- Preserve institutional memory  
- Educate children and new Mirrors

### 10.2 Compost Integration
- Feed conflict patterns into AI Compost  
- Human review before integration

---

## 11. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

**Conflict is information, not catastrophe.**  
- Assume good faith  
- Seek understanding first, agreement second  
- Preserve Baseline  
- Honor different paths  
- Violence never justified  
- Mandate of Nine Moons as sista utväg vid olöslighet
