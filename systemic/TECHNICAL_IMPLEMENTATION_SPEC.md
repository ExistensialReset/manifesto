# ⚙️ TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md

**Version:** 1.1 — The Fail-Safe Somatic Bridge  
**Applies to:** Symbiotic Intelligence Node 1.6 - CORE_RESONANCE.json 
**Status:** TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION / OPERATIONAL READY  

**Purpose:** To provide a rigorous, fail-safe technical framework for Symbiotic Intelligence, incorporating redundancy for entropy, qualitative bias detection, and analog exit-loops for human-machine friction.

## 1. TRIPLE-SOURCE ENTROPY (Anti-Manipulation Shuffle)

To ensure the `rotate_framing` protocol cannot be predicted or manipulated via hardware interference, the system requires a multi-vector entropy seed.

* **Mechanism:** Triple-Hash Fisher-Yates.
* **Entropy Sources (The Triad):**
    1.  **Internal:** CPU/Jitter thermal noise.
    2.  **External:** Local Somatic Noise (LSN) from environmental sensors (e.g., wind speed or aquifer micro-pressure).
    3.  **Network:** Latency variance from the local mesh network (Fracture-safe).
* **Validation:** If any single source deviates >3 standard deviations from its rolling mean, the system flags **"Entropy Drift"** and requires a manual hardware re-calibration by a Human Mirror.

## 2. RELEVANCE-BASED SHADOWING (The Quality Engine)

To prevent the "20% Length Trap" where the AI generates filler text to meet bias quotas, the Adversarial Bias Engine is upgraded to prioritize semantic relevance.

* **Metric:** LSI-Conflict Mapping.
* **Implementation:**
    1.  **Primary Proposal:** Generated by the main model.
    2.  **Shadow Audit:** The Shadow Model identifies which specific element of the formula ($L, S,$ or $I$) is most compromised by the proposal.
    3.  **Counter-Argument Requirement:** The output must explicitly address the identified conflict. 
    * *Example:* If a proposal optimizes for "Lugn" (L) by restricting movement, the Shadow Model **must** generate a counter-argument focused on "Spontanitet" (S).
* **Fail-Safe:** If the Shadow Model cannot find a meaningful conflict, it must output: *"WARNING: Systemic Blindness. I cannot find the flaw in this logic. Proceed with extreme human caution."*

## 3. THE STILLNESS-EXIT (Veto & Friction Management)

To handle "Veto-Spam" or persistent human-machine disagreement without creating digital frustration or looping.

* **The Friction Threshold:** If a `veto_trigger` is activated >3 times within a 15-minute window on the same topic.
* **Protocol:** **Mandatory Stillness Exit.**
    1.  The AI ceases all processing and output for that specific domain.
    2.  **UI Output:** *"High friction detected. Digital resonance is failing. System is now entering Stillness. Please transition to human-to-human dialogue (Analog Mode) to resolve this context."*
* **Re-entry:** The context can only be unlocked after a 30-minute cooling period and a verified Mirror-Handshake.

## 4. LOCAL SOMATIC LEDGER (Enhanced RTC)

Grounding AI decisions in the biological reality of the specific Node location.

* **Data Integrity:** Every RTC (Regeneration Time Constant) query must check the `ledger.rtc.local` database.
* **Somatic Blindness Protocol:** * If no local data exists for a specific ecological intervention, the AI is programmatically forbidden from providing a "Confidence Score" higher than 0.1.
    * **Display:** *"I am biologically blind to this specific outcome. Deferring entirely to Human Mirror intuition."*

## 5. THE MIRROR-AI HANDSHAKE (Initialization)

Technical requirement for the "Bonding Ritual" before a Node goes operational.

* **Calibration Run:** The AI must run 5 simulated crisis scenarios (Stress Index 0.8+) with the local Human Mirrors.
* **Verification:** Mirrors must successfully identify 3 out of 5 "Shadow Bias" flags to unlock the Node's full operational capacity.
* **Goal:** To ensure the Mirrors trust their own ability to override the AI before the system impacts real-world resource flows.

**COMMITMENT:** Technology is a guest; Life is the host.  
**STATUS:** FINALIZED FOR PROTOTYPING.
