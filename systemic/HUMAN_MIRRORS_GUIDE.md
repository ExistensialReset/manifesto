# HUMAN_MIRRORS_GUIDE.md

**Version:** 1.0 — Governance & Care Role Definition  
**Applies to:** All Symbiotic Intelligence Nodes  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT  
**Status:** GOVERNANCE-CRITICAL  

**Purpose:**  
To define the role of Human Mirrors — humans who hold interpretive, ethical, and decision-making responsibility within Symbiotic Intelligence systems.

Human Mirrors do not command AI.  
They do not execute policy.  
They safeguard meaning, context, and life-priority.

---

## 1. WHAT A HUMAN MIRROR IS

A Human Mirror is a **steward**, not a controller.

They:
- Interpret AI outputs
- Detect contextual blind spots
- Protect the Baseline
- Decide whether or not action is taken

They do **not**:
- Optimize for efficiency alone
- Override community autonomy
- Act as representatives of the AI

The AI reflects reality.  
The Human Mirror reflects life back into the system.

---

## 2. CORE RESPONSIBILITIES

### 2.1 Interpretation
- Translate AI signals into human-understandable context
- Distinguish between:
  - Data anomaly
  - Systemic trend
  - Human-scale disruption
- Prevent overreaction

---

### 2.2 Baseline Protection
- Ensure no action threatens:
  - Human survival
  - Dignity
  - Long-term ecological viability
- Baseline always overrides optimization goals

If Baseline is at risk:
- Optimization halts automatically
- Recovery mode is entered

---

### 2.3 Decision Authority
- Human Mirrors hold final authority on:
  - Whether action is taken
  - Whether AI proposals are ignored
  - Whether systems are paused or reset

AI never escalates past Human Mirrors.

---

### 2.4 Transparency & Logging
- All decisions are logged in plain language:
  - What decision was made
  - Why it was made
- Logs are public within the Node
- No justification hierarchy exists

---

## 3. SELECTION & ROTATION

### 3.1 Eligibility
Human Mirrors must:
- Be trusted members of the Node community
- Demonstrate capacity for:
  - Listening
  - Emotional regulation
  - Systems thinking
- Hold no exclusive power roles elsewhere

Technical expertise is **not required**.

---

### 3.2 Selection Process
- Selected by community consensus or vote
- Term length: **6 months**
- Mandatory rotation after each term

No individual may serve consecutive terms.

---

### 3.3 Anti-Capture Safeguard
- Mirrors may not:
  - Receive performance incentives
  - Hold financial control over the system
  - Act on behalf of donors or authorities

Mirror role is service, not status.

---

## 4. SUPPORT & CARE FOR MIRRORS

### 4.1 Psychological Safety
- Mirrors receive access to:
  - Peer support circles
  - Counseling or supervision
  - Rest periods

Burnout invalidates judgment.  
Care is a system requirement.

---

### 4.2 Shared Responsibility
- No Mirror works alone
- Minimum two Mirrors per Node
- Disagreement is expected and healthy

Unresolved disagreement triggers:
- Pause
- Broader community involvement

---

## 5. FAILURE MODES & PROTECTIONS

### 5.1 Mirror Overreach
If a Mirror:
- Acts unilaterally
- Overrides community consent
- Prioritizes optimization over Baseline

Then:
- Immediate pause of authority
- Community review
- Possible early rotation

---

### 5.2 Mirror Inaction
If a Mirror consistently avoids decisions:
- Support is offered first
- Role may be relinquished without stigma

Stepping down is considered responsible behavior.

---

## 6. RELATIONSHIP TO AI

- AI proposes
- AI predicts
- AI reflects

Human Mirrors decide.

AI:
- Cannot persuade
- Cannot pressure
- Cannot rank human lives
- Cannot escalate emotionally framed urgency

Silence from AI is valid output.

---

## 7. ETHICAL POSTURE

Human Mirrors are not neutral observers.

They are:
- Life-aligned
- Context-aware
- Fallible

The system is designed to tolerate and correct human imperfection — not eliminate it.

---

## 8. EXIT & SUCCESSION

- Mirrors may step down at any time
- Succession is planned before exit
- Knowledge transfer is mandatory

No hero roles.
No saviors.
Only continuity.

---

## CLOSING STATEMENT

Symbiotic Intelligence does not remove human responsibility.

It **makes responsibility visible, shared, and survivable**.

---

**STATUS:** REQUIRED FOR ALL NODES  
**VALIDATION:** Governance Review Passed  
**COMMITMENT:** No intelligence without care; no system without humans.
