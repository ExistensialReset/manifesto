# IRRECONCILABLE_DIFFERENCE_PROTOCOL.md
**Version:** 1.0 – Framework for Permanent Respectful Divergence  
**Authors:** Claude, Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** PROPOSED / GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** Define how Flow network handles Nodes with fundamental, unresolvable value conflicts.  
**Principle:** Unity through shared values (Baseline, L×S×I). Peaceful separation is valid when values diverge.

---

## 1. WHEN DIFFERENCES ARE IRRECONCILABLE

### 1.1 Purpose
- Scenarios where Nodes cannot coexist under shared governance:  
  - Ethical conflicts, technological philosophy, resource philosophy, governance structure, cultural practices.  
- Not resolvable through compromise.  

### 1.2 What This Is NOT
- Disagreements about resources, personalities, technical differences, temporary crises → use INTER_NODE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md.

---

## 2. RECOGNITION PROCESS

### 2.1 Identifying Irreconcilability
1. Exhaust standard conflict resolution  
2. Declaration of irreconcilability (written statement)  
3. Verification council (neutral Mirrors) confirms  

> If confirmed → Separation Protocol

---

## 3. SEPARATION PROTOCOL

### 3.1 Principles
- No violence, baseline guaranteed, transparency, reversibility, mutual recognition.

### 3.2 Logistical Separation
- Step 1: Resource division  
- Step 2: AI & Data handling  
- Step 3: Economic ties cessation  
- Step 4: Communication boundaries

### 3.3 Timeline
- Month 1: Recognition & planning  
- Months 2-3: Logistics  
- Month 4: Implementation  
- Month 6: Review  
- Annual check-ins first 3 years

## 4. MAINTAINING BASELINE
- Non-negotiable: Essential resources maintained.  
- Violations: Intervention by Mirrors, restore resources, investigate.

---

## 5. CHILDREN
- Ages 6-17: Tailored education about separation.  
- Inter-Node relationships allowed, transfers at 14+, case-by-case.

---

## 6. RECONNECTION PATHWAYS
- Reasons: value shift, new generation, external crisis, new understanding  
- Process: request → exploratory dialogue → trial coordination → full reconnection

---

## 7. NETWORK EFFECTS
- Other Nodes: coordinate with both, one, or remain neutral  
- Fragmentation is informational, not failure

---

## 8. SPECIAL CASES
- Multi-way splits  
- Entire regional split → maintain own Regional Coordination Layer, global observation optional

**STATUS:** PROPOSED / GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK  
**COMMITMENT:** Respectful divergence, maintain Baseline, education for next generation
