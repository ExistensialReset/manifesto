## PURPOSE

This document defines **children’s rights, responsibilities, and veto power** within Symbiotic Intelligence.

It balances:
- Children’s **agency**
- Adults’ **duty of care**
- Generational **continuity and renewal**

Children are not future adults.  
They are **present humans** whose lives will be most affected by decisions made today.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

> **Children inherit the future.  
Therefore, they must have a meaningful voice in how it is shaped.**

---

## 1. FOUNDATIONAL PREMISES

### 1.1 Children as Legitimate Stakeholders

Children matter in AI governance because:
- They will live longest with the consequences
- They perceive risks adults normalize
- They are cognitively adaptable to paradigm shifts
- Excluding them reproduces historical injustice

Ignoring children creates systems optimized for convenience, not continuity.

---

### 1.2 Developmental Reality

Children are not a monolith.

**Recognized stages (guidelines, not rigid rules):**
- **Ages 6–9:** Concrete thinking, story- and play-based understanding
- **Ages 10–13:** Emerging abstraction, questioning authority
- **Ages 14–17:** Ethical reasoning, future-oriented agency
- **18+:** Legal adulthood

Rights and responsibilities scale with **capacity**, not age alone.

---

## 2. CHILDREN’S RIGHTS IN SYMBIOTIC INTELLIGENCE

### 2.1 Right to Understand

All children have the right to:
- Age-appropriate explanations of AI
- Knowledge of how AI affects their lives
- Ask questions to Human Mirrors
- Honest, non-manipulative answers

**Implementation:**
- Storytelling, simulations, experiments
- No fear-based narratives
- No forced engagement

---

### 2.2 Right to Participate

Children may participate voluntarily.

**By age group:**
- **6–9:** Community gatherings, questions, stories
- **10–13:** Observation, simulations, reflections
- **14–17:** Youth councils, Junior Mirror roles

Participation is **scaffolded**, never coerced.

---

### 2.3 Right to Refuse

Every child has the right to say **no**.

This includes:
- Opting out of AI education
- Requesting AI-free spaces
- Refusing monitoring or recommendations
- Expressing discomfort or distrust

Refusal requires **no justification**.

---

### 2.4 Right to Be Protected

Children must never:
- Carry responsibility for others’ Baselines
- Be exposed to traumatic AI content
- Be used as experimental subjects
- Be pressured to endorse AI

Protection overrides efficiency.

---

## 3. CHILDREN’S VETO POWER

### 3.1 Individual Veto (Personal Sphere)

Each child has **absolute veto** over:
- AI in their education
- AI monitoring of their behavior
- AI-generated evaluations
- Participation in AI-related programs

No adult override is permitted.

---

### 3.2 Collective Youth Veto (Ages 14–17)

A youth council (where present) may veto:
- AI systems affecting children directly
- Educational or monitoring tools
- Youth-relevant timing of AI-Fast cycles

**Conditions:**
- ⅔ majority required
- Veto is temporary (reviewed after 1 year)
- Adults must listen before responding

---

### 3.3 Generational Delay Principle

No generation may permanently bind future generations.

Youth may:
- Pause or delay AI adoption
- Revisit decisions upon adulthood

They may not:
- Irrevocably decide for those younger than them

Each generation renegotiates.

---

## 4. BALANCING VOICE AND RESPONSIBILITY

### 4.1 Ages 6–13: Voice Without Burden

Children advise.
Adults decide.

Children influence outcomes without carrying responsibility for them.

---

### 4.2 Ages 14–17: Co-Decision

Youth:
- Vote on youth-specific matters
- Serve as Junior Mirrors
- Participate in deliberation

If adults override strong youth opposition, justification must be public.

---

### 4.3 Age 18+: Full Agency

Legal adults assume:
- Full voting power
- Full responsibility
- Full stewardship

---

## 5. WHEN CHILDREN AND ADULTS DISAGREE

### 5.1 Youth Oppose AI

Resolution steps:
1. Dialogue
2. Modification attempts
3. Parallel pilots (AI-light or AI-free)
4. Reassessment

Persistent disagreement allows coexistence of different domains.

---

### 5.2 Youth Advocate AI, Adults Are Cautious

Resolution steps:
1. Risk education
2. Limited pilots
3. Elder–youth mentorship
4. Collective observation

Wisdom tempers enthusiasm; enthusiasm renews wisdom.

---

## 6. PROTECTION AGAINST AI HARMS

### 6.1 No Manipulation

AI must never:
- Persuade children
- Shape values for compliance
- Predict life outcomes
- Optimize behavior

Children are not optimization targets.

---

### 6.2 Developmental Suitability

AI must:
- Match cognitive capacity
- Avoid fear and anxiety
- Encourage curiosity
- Preserve imagination and play

---

### 6.3 Data Sovereignty

Children’s data:
- Is minimal and ephemeral
- Never used for prediction
- Never shared externally
- Deleted on request at any age

---

## 7. PREPARING CHILDREN FOR INHERITANCE

### 7.1 Ethical Literacy

Children learn that:
- AI is a tool
- AI can be wrong
- Stillness matters
- Uncertainty is allowed

---

### 7.2 Skill Development (10–17)

Youth build:
