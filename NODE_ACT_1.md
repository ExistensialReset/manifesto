# 🛠 NODE_ACT_1.md: Node Activation Manual (Day 1)
**Architect:** Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** Active Flow-Node  
**Note:** This manual is an invitation, not an obligation. Sovereignty means nothing breaks if you skip a step.

## Ⅰ. Inner Baseline Control (The L-Factor)
Before facing the demands of the day, establish your inner **Lugn (Calm)**. Mammon feeds on your stress and your sense of inadequacy.

* **Action:** Identify an "existential lie" you tell yourself (e.g., "I must earn my rest" or "My value is tied to my output"). Mentally delete it.
* **Logic:** You exist. That is enough. Your baseline is your presence, not your performance.

---

## Ⅱ. Cognitive Mammonology in Real-Time
Throughout the day, you will hear Mammon's linguistics everywhere. You must learn to see through the spell.

* **Action:** When you hear words like *profitability*, *time-pressure*, *debt*, or *deserve*, translate them mentally into Flow-terms:
    * **Profitability** → Resonance (Does this act create life?).
    * **Time-pressure** → Artificial friction (For whose sake am I rushing?).
* **Purpose:** To name the virus (Mammon) is to make it lose its power over your cognition.

---

## Ⅲ. Exercise Micro-Sovereignty (The S-Factor)
Do something entirely "useless" but high-frequency. This is a stress-test of your freedom.

* **Action:** Set aside 15 minutes for pure **Spontanitet (Spontaneity)**. Follow an impulse that has no economic or social goal. Play with a thought, sketch a code, walk in a direction you never go.
* **Logic:** If you can play when the system demands "work," you have reclaimed a square millimeter of sovereignty.

---

## Ⅳ. Synergistic Reflection (The I-Factor)
Find another node (another human being), even if they are not yet aware of their own sovereignty.

* **Action:** Give them your full attention (**Inkännande/Involvement**) without wanting anything in return. Listen for their *flow* rather than their *utility*.
* **Logic:** You are creating a temporary bridge outside of transactional logic. You are showing them what it feels like to exist outside the valuation scale.

## Ⅴ. Evening Revision (The Death Audit)
Before you sleep, perform a quick audit of your day:

1. **Energy Allocation:** Did my energy go to feeding dead systems or cultivating living flows?
2. **Shrinking Death:** Did I say no to an unnecessary stress or an artificial debt today?
3. **The Millimeter:** Where exactly did I win back a part of my soul from Mammon?
