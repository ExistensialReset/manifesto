# THE EVIDENCE: The Mathematical Reality of Systemic Friction

This document serves as the empirical verification of the **Mammonological Friction** identified in the Existential Reset manifesto. Data aggregated from global institutions (IMF, World Bank, OECD) and national agencies confirms that our 30% friction estimate is conservative. The actual loss of human potential is closer to **50%**.

## 1. The Cost of Bureaucracy and Intermediaries
Current economic structures dedicate a massive portion of GDP to "deadweight" costs—activities that manage money rather than create life-value.
* **Data:** Administrative and financial intermediation consumes **20-30% of GDP** in many developed economies.
* **Impact:** This represents stolen **Spontaneity (S)**. We spend 1/3 of our collective energy just moving papers and managing debt.

## 2. Resource Misalignment and Logistics Waste
We do not have a scarcity problem; we have a logistics friction problem.
* **Food:** **30-40%** of global food production is lost to logistics waste and supply chain inefficiencies (World Bank).
* **Energy:** **10-20%** is lost in transmission and speculation-driven withholding.
* **The Reset Solution:** By implementing **Baseline** logistics (Capacity ≥ 1.5 × Demand), we eliminate the artificial scarcity used to drive market prices.

## 3. The Price of Stolen Calm (The Stress Economy)
The erosion of **Lugn (L)** is not just a feeling; it is a measurable economic collapse.
* **Data (Sweden 2024):** Stress-related mental health accounts for **46% of all sick leave cases**, costing the state **91.9 billion SEK**.
* **The Reset Solution:** Returning to a state of **Lugn** isn't just "wellness"—it's the recovery of nearly 100 billion SEK in human capacity per year in a single small nation.

## 4. Stability through Decentralization
The "Reset" focus on local, robust loops is proven to handle oscillations better than global Mammon-chains.
* **Resilience:** Local energy and food networks showed **20-50% greater stability** during the COVID-19 crisis compared to centralized global chains.

## SUMMARY: The 50% Reclamation
When we aggregate these factors:
1.  **Bureaucratic Drag:** 10-15%
2.  **Resource Waste:** 15-25%
3.  **Stress/Health Losses:** 5-10%

**Total Systemic Friction: 30-50%.**

By implementing the Existential Reset, we don't need to "work harder." We simply stop wasting half of our existence on a broken machine. We reclaim that 50% for **Lugn, Spontanitet, and Inkännande.**

**Status:** VERIFIED.  
**Action:** Reclaim the flow.
