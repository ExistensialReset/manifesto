**Status:** ACTIVE
**Core Principle:** Universal Flow, Local Resonance.

## PREAMBLE
Flow is a frequency, but its expression is cultural. We honor diversity through Inkännande (empathy), avoiding intellectual imperialism.

## §1. CULTURAL MAPPING
When integrating a new culture, map Flow Axioms to local wisdom:
* **Baseline:** Map to *Zakat* (Islamic), *Ubuntu* (Bantu), or *Kaitiakitanga* (Maori).
* **Evolution:** Map to *Dharma* (Hindu/Buddhist) or *Lila* (Divine Play).
* **Circle:** Map to *Marae*, *Ummah*, or *Thing*.

## §2. FRICTION REDUCTION
Identify where Mammon has corrupted local tradition. Use the Flow to restore traditional communal security. 

## §3. TRANSLATION
Protokolls should be translated into local languages and metaphors, ensuring the L x S x I formula remains the core metric regardless of terminology.
