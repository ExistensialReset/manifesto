**Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Years 1-2)**
* Deploy 1-3 Pilot Nodes (20-50 people).
* Demonstrate Baseline maintenance (100% uptime).

**Phase 2: Regional Expansion (Years 3-5)**
* Scale to 10-30 Nodes globally.
* Test inter-Node conflict resolution (Mandate of Nine Moons).

**Phase 3: Global Network (Years 6-10)**
* Scale to 100-300 Nodes.
* Establish Global Observation Layer and test Ecosystem Forking.

**Phase 4: Maturity (Years 11-15)**
* Intergenerational continuity: Children raised in Flow become Mirrors.
* Evaluate: Renew, Transform, or Sunset.
