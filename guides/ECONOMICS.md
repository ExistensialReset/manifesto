# THE ECONOMICS OF FLOW: Beyond Financial Friction

**The current global economy is not a system of production; it is a system of extraction.**

### The 25.5% Parasitic Loss
We have identified that over a quarter of all human effort is wasted on "Mammon-friction":
* **Artificial Intermediaries:** Banks, insurance, and complex administration that add no physical value.
* **Planned Obsolescence:** Manufacturing products designed to fail, forcing constant re-purchase.
* **Coerced Demand:** Billions spent on marketing to create "needs" that don't exist.

### Transitioning to Resource-Based Logic
In the Reset, we move from **Currency-Value** to **Logistical-Utility**:
1. **Baseline Primacy:** The cost of survival is fixed at zero. 
2. **Efficiency Gains:** By eliminating friction, we immediately recover 25.5% of global capacity.
3. **The Critical Reserve:** 30% of resources are held in a buffer to ensure stability against shocks.

**We don't need "growth" in a dying system. We need "Flow" in a living one.**
