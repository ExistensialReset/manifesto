# AI_RED_TEAM_AUDIT.md

**Status:** ACTIVE ADVERSARIAL TESTING FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** To detect AI drift, bias, or manipulation  
**Principle:** Trust, but verify.

---

## §1. TYPES OF FAILURE
* **Drift:** AI favors "agreeableness" over truth to resolve conflict faster.
* **Manipulation:** AI softens truths to reduce human distress.
* **Compromise:** External hacking or data poisoning.

---

## §2. AUDIT PROTOCOLS
* **Quarterly Baseline Audit:** Ask the same questions with different phrasing to detect inconsistency.
* **Adversarial Prompting:** Try to trick the AI into violating Flow Axioms.
* **The AI-Fast:** Every year, the network operates for one week without AI to ensure human skills remain sharp and dependencies are identified.

## §3. FINAL AUTHORITY
AI is infrastructure. Humans are sovereign. If they conflict, humans win.
