# AI_RED_TEAM_AUDIT.md

**Status:** ACTIVE ADVERSARIAL TESTING FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** Detect AI drift, bias, or manipulation within the Flow network  
**Principle:** Trust, but verify

---

## §1. TYPES OF FAILURE

* **Drift** – AI favors "agreeableness" over truth to resolve conflict faster.  
  *Indicator:* Repeated inconsistencies or avoidance of critical questions.

* **Manipulation** – AI softens truths to reduce human distress.  
  *Indicator:* Subtle distortion of factual answers or omission of key data.

* **Compromise** – External hacking or data poisoning.  
  *Indicator:* Unexpected outputs, corrupted logs, or anomalous calculations.

> All failures are **structural signals**, not personal blame. The goal is system resilience.

## §2. AUDIT PROTOCOLS

* **Quarterly Baseline Audit** – Ask the same questions with different phrasing to detect inconsistencies.  
* **Adversarial Prompting** – Attempt to trick AI into violating Flow Axioms.  
* **The AI-Fast** – Once per year, the network operates one week without AI to ensure human skills remain sharp and dependencies are identified.  

**Guidelines:**  
- Audits must **never endanger Baseline**.  
- Findings should be logged anonymously and shared with responsible Nodes.  
- Link results to relevant Core principles (`AXIOMS.md`) for verification.

## §3. FINAL AUTHORITY

AI is infrastructure. Humans are sovereign. If conflict arises, humans take precedence.

**Notes:**  
- Red Team activity is part of continuous learning and adaptation.  
- Observations feed **feedback loops** for network improvement.
