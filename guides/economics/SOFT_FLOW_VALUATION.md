# 🫂 SOFT_FLOW_VALUATION.md

**Status:** PRACTICAL ETHICS  
**Purpose:** To ensure that emotional labor, deep listening, and relational care are valued equally with physical labor.  
**Principle:** The heart’s weaving is the foundation of the house.

## 1. THE INVISIBILITY TRAP
In Mammon-logic, building a wall is "work," but sitting with a grieving friend is "nothing." In Flow, the second is often more critical for systemic stability (**L - Calm**).

## 2. CATEGORIES OF SOFT FLOW
When tracking contributions in the Transparency Ledger, use these categories:
- **Presence (P):** Active listening, holding space, crisis support.
- **Harmony (H):** Conflict mediation, circle facilitation, aesthetic care.
- **Incubation (In):** Thinking, dreaming, and sensing the next Spontaneous (S) shift.

---

## 3. PARITY OF EFFORT
**The 1:1 Rule:** One hour of deep emotional presence (P) is valued exactly the same as one hour of manual labor (L). 
- If the Circle values a programmer at 200 units/hour, the person cleaning the floor and the person mediating a conflict are also 200 units/hour.

---

## 4. THE RESONANCE CHECK
If a member is contributing heavily in "Soft Flow" but feels exhausted, the Circle must intervene:
- Soft Flow is high-energy work. 
- It requires its own Baseline of silence and withdrawal.
- **Warning:** Do not let Soft Flow become a "hidden trap" for those socialized to put others first.

---

**Guidance:** Value the weaver as much as the wood.
