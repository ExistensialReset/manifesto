# THE ECONOMICS OF FLOW: Beyond Financial Friction

**The current global economy is not a system of production; it is a system of extraction.**  

This guide explains the key inefficiencies in today’s economic system and outlines the logic of Flow as an alternative.

## 1. The Current System: Extraction, Not Production

Human effort today is largely redirected into supporting artificial systems that create no real value. Money, debt, and marketing drive work that does not increase human or ecological well-being.  

**Key insight:** The system prioritizes Mammon-friction over life-sustaining activity.

## 2. The 25.5% Parasitic Loss

Studies and simulations show that **roughly a quarter of all human effort is wasted** maintaining unnecessary friction.

| Sector / Mechanism           | Global Impact | Notes |
|-------------------------------|---------------|-------|
| Artificial Intermediaries     | 1–5% GDP / Labor | Banks, insurance, bureaucracy that add no physical value |
| Planned Obsolescence          | 15–20% Throughput | Products designed to fail; constant re-purchase required |
| Coerced Demand & Advertising  | ~1% GDP | Marketing to create “needs” that do not exist |

**Total Estimated Parasitic Loss:** ~25.5% of global capacity.  
**Implication:** Flow can immediately reclaim a significant fraction of human productivity by eliminating this friction.

## 3. Transitioning to Resource-Based Logic

The Reset shifts the economy from **Currency-Value** to **Logistical-Utility**:

1. **Baseline Primacy:** Cost of survival is treated as fixed at zero. No one is denied essentials.  
2. **Efficiency Gains:** Eliminating friction recovers 25.5% of global capacity.  
3. **Critical Reserve:** 30% of resources are held in a buffer to ensure stability and absorb shocks.  

> **Principle:** Growth is not the goal. Flow and resilience are.

## 4. Implications for Flow Nodes

- **Local Nodes** can operate independently of the debt-based system by pooling tools, energy, and skills.  
- **Circles** share critical reserves to safeguard Baseline health.  
- **Network Effects** amplify resilience: the more overlapping nodes, the less any single Mammon-friction can disrupt life.

**Summary:**  
The Flow economic model is not about overthrowing systems, but bypassing friction and redirecting human energy where it truly matters. Reclaiming 25.5% of wasted effort is a practical, measurable start toward existential sovereignty.
