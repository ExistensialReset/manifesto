# 🍄 INTER-NODE_FLUIDITY_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE / NETWORK LAYER  
**Purpose:** To enable resource movement between autonomous Nodes without creating debt, trade imbalances, or central authority.  
**Principle:** Mycorrhizal Exchange. Resources move from areas of stagnation/surplus to areas of need/growth.

## 1. THE MYCORRHIZAL PULSE (Signals)
Nodes communicate through "vibrations" rather than orders:
- **Surplus Signal (S+):** A Node broadcasts that a resource (tools, energy, seeds, knowledge) is stagnant and needs to flow.
- **Need Signal (N-):** A Node broadcasts a Baseline gap. 

**Rule:** An (S+) signal should seek the nearest (N-) signal to minimize logistical friction.

---

## 2. THE NON-LINEAR RETURN
In Flow, Node A helps Node B, but Node B does **not** owe Node A. 
- The "return" is systemic, not transactional. 
- By strengthening Node B, Node A strengthens the entire network's resilience, which ultimately secures Node A's own future.

---

## 3. ANTI-STAGNATION PRESSURE
Accumulation is seen as a system risk (clogged flow).
- If a Node’s Critical Reserve exceeds 50% of its annual Baseline needs, the "Pressure" to export surplus increases.
- Surplus should be "pushed" out to seed new Nodes or support struggling ones.

---

## 4. LOGISTICAL RELAY
If Node A (Gothenburg) has a surplus that Node B (Lagos) needs:
- Intermediary Nodes (the "Relay") support the movement.
- Each relay point adds its own L x S x I resonance, ensuring the resource arrives not as "aid," but as shared life-force.

**Commitment:** We do not trade. We circulate.
