# 🪙 MICRO-ECONOMY GUIDE: Sharing Money Without Hierarchy

**Status:** PRACTICAL PROTOCOL  
**For:** 2-7 people who want to share economic resources within Flow  
**Core Principle:** No debt. No hierarchy. No shame.

---

## PREAMBLE: MONEY IS HARD

Let's be honest:

**Money is where most communities fall apart.**

Not because people are greedy.  
But because:
- We've been trained to see scarcity
- We've been taught to keep score
- We're scared of being exploited
- We're scared of being the exploiter

**This guide doesn't pretend it's easy.**

It just gives you tools to try.

## PART I: THE THREE MODELS

There are three ways to share money in a Micro-Circle.

**None is "right".** **Pick what feels safe for your group.**

---

### MODEL 1: The Pooled Fund (Full Sharing)

**How it works:**

Everyone puts money into one shared account/envelope.

**All Baseline expenses paid from this:**
- Rent (if shared housing)
- Food (if shared meals)
- Utilities
- Healthcare (if pooled)

**Who contributes:**
- Everyone gives what they can
- No fixed amount
- No judgment if someone can't give this month

**Example:**

**5 people, shared house:**
- Total rent: 10,000 kr/month
- Person A: has job, gives 3,500 kr
- Person B: has part-time work, gives 2,000 kr
- Person C: on disability, gives 1,500 kr
- Person D: unemployed, gives 500 kr
- Person E: student, gives 500 kr
- **Total: 8,000 kr (2,000 kr short)**

**What happens with shortfall:**
- Circle decides together: reduce expenses? Find temporary work? Ask Regional Circle for loan?
- **No one is blamed**
- **No one is kicked out**

**Pros:**
- True communal living
- Strong solidarity
- No individual financial stress

**Cons:**
- Requires deep trust
- Hard to join/leave
- Can create resentment if contributions feel unfair

**Best for:**
- Small groups (3-5 people)
- High trust
- Long-term commitment

---

### MODEL 2: The Split Bill (Proportional Sharing)

**How it works:**

Shared expenses are divided **proportionally by income**.

**Example:**

**3 people, shared apartment:**
- Total rent: 9,000 kr/month

**Income:**
- Person A: 20,000 kr/month
- Person B: 12,000 kr/month
- Person C: 4,000 kr/month
- **Total income: 36,000 kr**

**Proportional split:**
- Person A: 20k/36k × 9,000 = 5,000 kr
- Person B: 12k/36k × 9,000 = 3,000 kr
- Person C: 4k/36k × 9,000 = 1,000 kr

**Pros:**
- Feels fair (richer pay more)
- Protects poorest
- Still allows individual autonomy

**Cons:**
- Requires transparency about income
- Can create hierarchy ("I pay more so I decide more")
- Hard to calculate with fluctuating income

**Best for:**
- Medium groups (3-7 people)
- Mixed income levels
- Medium trust

---

### MODEL 3: The Solidarity Network (Opt-In Help)

**How it works:**

Everyone manages their own money.

**But:**

When someone can't make rent/food/bills – they ask the Circle.

**Circle decides:**
- Can we help?
- How much?
- For how long?

**This is NOT a loan.** **No repayment expected.**

**Example:**

Person A loses their job.  
Can't pay 3,000 kr rent this month.

Circle meets:
- Person B can give 1,000 kr
- Person C can give 500 kr
- Person D can't give money but offers to cook all meals this week (saves Person A 800 kr)
- **Total: 2,300 kr**

**Still 700 kr short.**

**Options:**
1. Person A negotiates with landlord (delay payment)
2. Circle does one-time fundraiser (sell something, do gig work together)
3. Person A accepts 700 kr shortfall and figures it out

**Pros:**
- Maintains individual autonomy
- Flexible
- Easy to join/leave

**Cons:**
- Less stable
- Relies on asking (which is hard)
- Can create guilt/shame dynamics

**Best for:**
- Loose groups
- People not ready for full sharing
- Transition phase

---

## PART II: HOW TO HANDLE HARD SITUATIONS

**These WILL happen.** **Here's how to navigate them.**

---

### SITUATION 1: Someone Isn't Contributing

**What it looks like:**

Person X has money (you see them buying things).  
But they "can't" contribute to shared expenses.

**What NOT to do:**
- Accuse them of lying
- Kick them out immediately
- Gossip behind their back

**What TO do:**

**Step 1: Check-in (private, gentle)**

*"Hey, I noticed you haven't contributed the last two months. Is everything okay?"*

Listen.

Maybe:
- They have debt collectors taking everything
- They're supporting family you don't know about
- They're scared to say they can't afford it

**Step 2: Collaborative problem-solving**

*"What would help? Can we adjust the amount? Can you contribute differently (labor instead of money)?"*

**Step 3: Circle conversation (if needed)**

If private check-in doesn't work:

Bring to Circle (with person present).

*"We're noticing an imbalance. Can we talk about it?"*

Focus on:
- Needs (not blame)
- Solutions (not punishment)

**Step 4: Accept incompatibility**

Sometimes people aren't ready for shared economy.

That's okay.

**Graceful exit protocol:**
- Give 30-day notice
- Help them find other housing/situation
- No hard feelings
- Baseline still protected (help with transition)

---

### SITUATION 2: Someone Is Struggling But Won't Ask

**What it looks like:**

Person Y clearly can't afford things.  
But they don't ask for help.

**What NOT to do:**
- Force help on them
- Make them feel pitied
- Announce publicly "we all know you're struggling"

**What TO do:**

**Offer structurally, not personally:**

Instead of:  
*"I know you're poor, let me give you money."*

Try:  
*"Circle has surplus this month. We're distributing to anyone who needs. Want some?"*

**Make asking easy:**

Create anonymous request system:
- Box where people write needs
- No names
- Circle collectively decides how to help

---

### SITUATION 3: You Feel Taken Advantage Of

**What it looks like:**

You're contributing a lot.  
Others aren't.  
You're getting resentful.

**What NOT to do:**
- Silently build resentment
- Explode one day
- Quit Circle in anger

**What TO do:**

**Step 1: Check your feelings**

Is this real exploitation, or am I just tired?

Sometimes "feeling used" = "I need rest" not "they're using me."

**Step 2: Share honestly**

*"I'm feeling some resentment about contributions. Can we talk about it?"*

**Step 3: Adjust the model**

Maybe Model 1 (full sharing) isn't working.  
Maybe switch to Model 2 or 3.

**That's not failure.** **That's adaptation.**

---

### SITUATION 4: Someone Wants to Leave

**What it looks like:**

Person Z wants out of the shared economy.

**What NOT to do:**
- Guilt them into staying
- Demand "repayment" for past help
- Cut them off from Circle entirely

**What TO do:**

**Honor their choice:**

*"Okay. What do you need to transition safely?"*

**Support their exit:**
- Help find new housing/situation
- Give reasonable transition time (30-90 days)
- Offer to stay friends even if not in economic Circle

**Document what was learned:**

*"Why did they leave? What can we learn?"*

Not to blame.  
**To improve.**

---

## PART III: TRACKING WITHOUT DEBT

**The paradox:**

You need to know who contributes what.  
But you don't want to create "scorekeeping."

**How to balance:**

---

### THE TRANSPARENCY LEDGER

**Keep a simple shared document:**

| Date | Person | Contribution | Type | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|------|-------|
| Feb 1 | A | 3,500 kr | Money | Rent share |
| Feb 1 | B | 2,000 kr | Money | Rent share |
| Feb 3 | C | 4 hours | Labor | Repaired heating |
| Feb 5 | D | 1 bag rice | Food | Bulk buy |

**Why this helps:**
- Everyone sees contributions
- Prevents "I do everything" feeling
- Recognizes non-monetary contributions

**Important rules:**
1. **This is NOT a debt ledger** (no one "owes" based on past)
2. **Everyone can see it** (transparency prevents resentment)
3. **Update weekly** (don't let it pile up)

---

### CONVERTING NON-MONEY TO VALUE

**Labor:** 1 hour = 100-200 kr (decide together what feels fair)

**Food/goods:** Actual cost (receipts)

**Skills:** Valued equally regardless of "market rate" (massage = coding = gardening)

---

## PART IV: CONFLICT RESOLUTION

**When money conflicts arise:**

**Step 1: Pause (24-72 hours)**

Don't make decisions in anger.

**Step 2: Private conversation first**

Try to resolve 1-on-1 before bringing to Circle.

**Step 3: Circle mediation**

If needed, bring to full Circle.

**Rules:**
- Everyone speaks
- No interrupting
- Focus on needs, not blame
- Seek solutions, not punishment

**Step 4: Outside help**

If Circle can't resolve:
- Ask another Circle for mediation
- Use SHARED_RESOURCE_CONFLICT.md protocol

**Step 5: Graceful separation**

If truly incompatible:
- Exit protocol
- Baseline protected
- No shame

---

## PART V: STARTING SIMPLE

**Don't start with full pooled economy.**

**Try this progression:**

### WEEK 1-4: Share one meal/week

Cook together.  
Split cost.  
Learn to collaborate.

### WEEK 5-8: Share one tool/resource

Lawn mower, car, washing machine.  
Practice lending/borrowing.

### WEEK 9-12: Pool for one expense

Maybe internet bill.  
Small amount.  
Low stakes.

### MONTH 4-6: Consider bigger sharing

If smaller experiments worked – maybe try rent sharing.

**If not – stay at current level.**

**There's no shame in partial sharing.**

---

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

**Money is Mammon's strongest weapon.**

It makes us:
- Compete
- Hoard
- Fear
- Judge

**Flow doesn't erase money overnight.**

**But it creates spaces where:**
- Sharing is normal
- Asking is okay
- Helping doesn't create debt
- Struggling doesn't mean exile

**Start small.** **Be honest.** **Be gentle with each other.**

**And remember:**

**Your worth is not your contribution.**
