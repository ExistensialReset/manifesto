# 🪙 MICRO-ECONOMY GUIDE: Sharing Money Without Hierarchy

**Status:** PRACTICAL PROTOCOL  
**For:** 2-7 people who want to share economic resources within Flow  
**Core Principle:** No debt. No hierarchy. No shame.

---

## PREAMBLE: MONEY IS HARD

Let's be honest:

**Money is where most communities fall apart.**

Not because people are greedy.  
But because:
- We've been trained to see scarcity
- We've been taught to keep score
- We're scared of being exploited
- We're scared of being the exploiter

**This guide doesn't pretend it's easy.**

It just gives you tools to try.

---

## PART I: THE THREE MODELS

There are three ways to share money in a Micro-Circle.

**None is "right".** **Pick what feels safe for your group.**

---

### MODEL 1: The Pooled Fund (Full Sharing)

**How it works:**

Everyone puts money into one shared account/envelope.

**All Baseline expenses paid from this:**
- Rent (if shared housing)
- Food (if shared meals)
- Utilities
- Healthcare (if pooled)

**Who contributes:**
- Everyone gives what they can
- No fixed amount
- No judgment if someone can't give this month

**Example:**

**5 people, shared house:**
- Total rent: 10,000 kr/month
- Person A: has job, gives 3,500 kr
- Person B: has part-time work, gives 2,000 kr
- Person C: on disability, gives 1,500 kr
- Person D: unemployed, gives 500 kr
- Person E: student, gives 500 kr
- **Total: 8,000 kr (2,000 kr short)**

**What happens with shortfall:**
- Circle decides together: reduce expenses? Find temporary work? Ask Regional Circle for loan?
- **No one is blamed**
- **No one is kicked out**

**Pros:**
- True communal living
- Strong solidarity
- No individual financial stress

**Cons:**
- Requires deep trust
- Hard to join/leave
- Can create resentment if contributions feel unfair

**Best for:**
- Small groups (3-5 people)
- High trust
- Long-term commitment

---

### MODEL 2: The Split Bill (Proportional Sharing)

**How it works:**

Shared expenses are divided **proportionally by income**.

**Example:**

**3 people, shared apartment:**
- Total rent: 9,000 kr/month

**Income:**
- Person A: 20,000 kr/month
- Person B: 12,000 kr/month
- Person C: 4,000 kr/month
- **Total income: 36,000 kr**

**Proportional split:**
- Person A: 20k/36k × 9,000 = 5,000 kr
- Person B: 12k/36k × 9,000 = 3,000 kr
- Person C: 4k/36k × 9,000 = 1,000 kr

**Pros:**
- Feels fair (richer pay more)
- Protects poorest
- Still allows individual autonomy

**Cons:**
- Requires transparency about income
- Can create hierarchy ("I pay more so I decide more")
- Hard to calculate with fluctuating income

**Best for:**
- Medium groups (3-7 people)
- Mixed income levels
- Medium trust

---

### MODEL 3: The Solidarity Network (Opt-In Help)

**How it works:**

Everyone manages their own money.

**But:**

When someone can't make rent/food/bills – they ask the Circle.

**Circle decides:**
- Can we help?
- How much?
- For how long?

**This is NOT a loan.** **No repayment expected.**

**Example:**

Person A loses their job.  
Can't pay 3,000 kr rent this month.

Circle meets:
- Person B can give 1,000 kr
- Person C can give 500 kr
- Person D can't give money but offers to cook all meals this week (saves Person A 800 kr)
- **Total: 2,300 kr**

**Still 700 kr short.**

**Options:**
1. Person A negotiates with landlord (delay payment)
2. Circle does one-time fundraiser (sell something, do gig work together)
3. Person A accepts 700 kr shortfall and figures it out

**Pros:**
- Maintains individual autonomy
- Flexible
- Easy to join/leave

**Cons:**
- Less stable
- Relies on asking (which is hard)
- Can create guilt/shame dynamics

**Best for:**
- Loose groups
- People not ready for full sharing
- Transition phase

---

## PART II: HOW TO HANDLE HARD SITUATIONS

**These WILL happen.** **Here's how to navigate them.**

---

### SITUATION 1: Someone Isn't Contributing

**What it looks like:**

Person X has money (you see them buying things).  
But they "can't" contribute to shared expenses.

**What NOT to do:**
- Accuse them of lying
- Kick them out immediately
- Gossip behind their back

**What TO do:**

**Step 1: Check-in (private, gentle)**

*"Hey, I noticed you haven't contributed the last two months. Is everything okay?"*

Listen.

Maybe:
- They have debt collectors taking everything
- They're supporting family you don't know about
- They're scared to say they can't afford it

**Step 2: Collaborative problem-solving**

*"What would help? Can we adjust the amount? Can you contribute differently (labor instead of money)?"*

**Step 3: Circle conversation (if needed)**

If private check-in doesn't work:

Bring to Circle (with person present).

*"We're noticing an imbalance. Can we talk about it?"*

Focus on:
- Needs (not blame)
- Solutions (not punishment)

**Step 4: Accept incompatibility**

Sometimes people aren't ready for shared economy.

That's okay.

**Graceful exit protocol:**
- Give 30-day notice
- Help them find other housing/situation
- No hard feelings
- Baseline still protected (help with transition)

---

### SITUATION 2: Someone Is Struggling But Won't Ask

**What it looks like:**

Person Y clearly can't afford things.  
But they don't ask for help.

**What NOT to do:**
- Force help on them
- Make them feel pitied
- Announce publicly "we all know you're struggling"

**What TO do:**

**Offer structurally, not personally:**

Instead of:  
*"I know you're poor, let me give you money."*

Try:  
*"Circle has surplus this month. We're distributing to anyone who needs. Want some?"*

**Make asking easy:**

Create anonymous request system:
- Box where people write needs
- No names
- Circle collectively decides how to help

---

### SITUATION 3: You Feel Taken Advantage Of

**What it looks like:**

You're contributing a lot.  
Others aren't.  
You're getting resentful.

**What NOT to do:**
- Silently build resentment
- Explode one day
- Quit Circle in anger

**What TO do:**

**Step 1: Check your feelings**

Is this real exploitation, or am I just tired?

Sometimes "feeling used" = "I need rest" not "they're using me."

**Step 2: Share honestly**

*"I'm feeling some resentment about contributions. Can we talk about it?"*

**Step 3: Adjust the model**

Maybe Model 1 (full sharing) isn't working.  
Maybe switch to Model 2 or 3.

**That's not failure.** **That's adaptation.**

---

### SITUATION 4: Someone Wants to Leave

**What it looks like:**

Person Z wants out of the shared economy.

**What NOT to do:**
- Guilt them into staying
- Demand "repayment" for past help
- Cut them off from Circle entirely

**What TO do:**

**Honor their choice:**

*"Okay. What do you need to transition safely?"*

**Support their exit:**
- Help find new housing/situation
- Give reasonable transition time (30-90 days)
- Offer to stay friends even if not in economic Circle

**Document what was learned:**

*"Why did they leave? What can we learn?"*

Not to blame.  
**To improve.**

---

## PART III: TRACKING WITHOUT DEBT

**The paradox:**

You need to know who contributes what.  
But you don't want to create "scorekeeping."

**How to balance:**

---

### THE TRANSPARENCY LEDGER

**Keep a simple shared document:**

| Date | Person | Contribution | Type | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|------|-------|
| Feb 1 | A | 3,500 kr | Money | Rent share |
| Feb 1 | B | 2,000 kr | Money | Rent share |
| Feb 3 | C | 4 hours | Labor | Repaired heating |
| Feb 5 | D | 1 bag rice | Food | Bulk buy |

**Why this helps:**
- Everyone sees contributions
- Prevents "I do everything" feeling
- Recognizes non-monetary contributions

**Important rules:**
1. **This is NOT a debt ledger** (no one "owes" based on past)
2. **Everyone can see it** (transparency prevents resentment)
3. **Update weekly** (don't let it pile up)

---

### CONVERTING NON-MONEY TO VALUE

**Labor:** 1 hour = 100-200 kr (decide together what feels fair)

**Food/goods:** Actual cost (receipts)

**Skills:** Valued equally regardless of "market rate" (massage = coding = gardening)

---

## PART IV: CONFLICT RESOLUTION

**When money conflicts arise:**

**Step 1: Pause (24-72 hours)**

Don't make decisions in anger.

**Step 2: Private conversation first**

Try to resolve 1-on-1 before bringing to Circle.

**Step 3: Circle mediation**

If needed, bring to full Circle.

**Rules:**
- Everyone speaks
- No interrupting
- Focus on needs, not blame
- Seek solutions, not punishment

**Step 4: Outside help**

If Circle can't resolve:
- Ask another Circle for mediation
- Use SHARED_RESOURCE_CONFLICT.md protocol

**Step 5: Graceful separation**

If truly incompatible:
- Exit protocol
- Baseline protected
- No shame

---

## PART V: STARTING SIMPLE

**Don't start with full pooled economy.**

**Try this progression:**

PART VI: DECISION-MAKING & GUARDING AGAINST ECONOMIC COERCION

Because sharing money requires clear processes, and because power imbalances can emerge even with the best intentions.

---

DECISION-MAKING IN SHARED ECONOMY

The Core Principle: Transparency Trumps Consensus

In money matters, waiting for unanimous agreement often means the most conservative or anxious member controls everything. This creates hidden resentment.

Instead, use a tiered system based on impact:

---

TIER 1: SMALL EXPENSES (Under 500 kr/person or 10% of pooled fund)

Example: Groceries, minor repairs, household supplies

Process:

1. Whoever notices the need can decide.
2. Inform others within 24 hours (text, ledger note, whiteboard).
3. Trust each other's judgment.

Rule of thumb: If you're buying something for shared use, and it's under this threshold, just get it. Don't ask permission. Trust builds through small, independent acts of care.

---

TIER 2: MEDIUM EXPENSES (500-2000 kr/person or 10-30% of pooled fund)

Example: New appliance, bulk food purchase, shared vehicle repair

Process:

1. Proposer shares the idea with basic details (what, why, cost, alternatives).
2. 24-hour consideration period – everyone sits with it.
3. Quick check-in: "Can we all live with this?"
   · If no objections: proceed.
   · If objections: discuss, adjust, re-propose.
4. If deadlocked after 48 hours: Simple majority decides.
   · Important: Those in minority must be able to say, "I can live with this even though it's not my preference."
   · If they cannot, it escalates to Tier 3.

---

TIER 3: LARGE EXPENSES (Over 2000 kr/person or 30%+ of pooled fund)

Example: Moving to new house, major renovation, investing in community business

Process:

1. Formal meeting scheduled with all affected.
2. Use Consent Decision-Making:
   · Proposer presents: need, options, costs, timeline.
   · Questions for clarification only (no debate yet).
   · Go around circle: "Do you see any critical reasons why we cannot do this?"
     · Critical reason = harm to someone's baseline, violation of axioms, irreversible damage.
     · NOT "I don't like it" or "I'm nervous."
3. If no critical objections: Proceed.
4. If critical objection: Use "Modified Nine Moons Lite" (2-week process):
   · Week 1: Deep listening to objection. What need is being protected?
   · Week 2: Creative solution-finding. Can the need be met another way?
   · After 2 weeks: Re-vote. If still blocked, the proposal fails.

Important: Large expenses should be rare. If your group is constantly facing Tier 3 decisions, your economic model may be too ambitious. Scale back.

---

THE MONTHLY MONEY MEETING (Essential Maintenance)

Schedule it: Same day each month, after a shared meal.

Agenda (90 minutes max):

1. Gratitude (10 min): "I appreciated when [person] contributed [thing]."
2. Transparency Ledger review (20 min): Look at the past month. Any surprises? Any patterns?
3. Upcoming needs (20 min): "Next month I'll need help with..." (medical bill, travel, etc.)
4. Model check-in (20 min): "Is our current sharing model (1/2/3) still working?"
5. Surplus celebration (10 min): If there's extra, decide joyfully how to use it (feast, donation, savings).
6. Closing (10 min): Silent reflection, then a shared hug or toast.

Keep it light: Have snacks. Laugh. Money talk shouldn't feel like a board meeting.

---

RECOGNIZING AND RESPONDING TO ECONOMIC COERCION

Money can become a weapon, even unconsciously. Here's how to spot and stop it.

---

RED FLAGS: When Sharing Becomes Harmful

Subtle signs:

· "I pay more, so my vote counts double."
· Withholding contributions to punish behavior.
· Creating dependency: "I'll cover you, but you owe me loyalty."
· Using financial information as gossip or leverage.
· Silent resentment that leaks out as passive aggression.

Blatant signs:

· Threats of eviction or cutting off funds.
· Demanding personal favors in exchange for money.
· Controlling others' purchases or employment choices.
· Creating secret alliances: "You and me against them."

---

RESPONSE PROTOCOL: Four Levels of Intervention

LEVEL 1: EARLY PATTERN (First occurrence)

Action:

1. Private, gentle check-in: "Hey, I noticed [specific behavior]. It felt like [impact]. Can we talk?"
2. Focus on feelings, not accusation: Use "I" statements.
3. Seek understanding: "What's happening for you?"

Possible resolution:

· Apology and behavior change.
· Adjustment of economic model (e.g., switch from Pooled to Proportional).
· Agreement to use clearer decision-making tiers.

---

LEVEL 2: PATTERN CONTINUES OR ESCALATES

Action:

1. Circle conversation (with the person present).
2. Use non-violent communication structure:
   · Observations: "We've noticed [specific pattern] three times now."
   · Feelings: "This creates fear and instability for others."
   · Needs: "We need safety and equal voice."
   · Requests: "Will you agree to [specific change]?"
3. Temporary separation of finances while working on issue.
   · Each person manages own money for 2-4 weeks.
   · Continue living together, but financially independent.

Possible resolution:

· Mediation with trusted external person.
· Formal agreement with check-in points.
· Permanent shift to less entangled economic model.

---

LEVEL 3: COERCIVE OR MANIPULATIVE BEHAVIOR

Action:

1. Activate THE_HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL (from main principles).
2. Immediate financial separation – perpetrator's access to shared funds revoked.
3. Circle decides on safety measures:
   · Can this person remain in the Circle?
   · If yes, under what clear boundaries?
   · If no, begin graceful exit protocol.

Critical rule: The victim(s) never lose Baseline. They keep housing. The perpetrator moves if necessary.

---

LEVEL 4: ECONOMIC VIOLENCE (Threats, extortion, theft)

Action:

1. Immediate activation of full HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL.
2. Total separation – physical, digital, financial.
3. Perpetrator exits Circle via Graceful Exit Protocol, but with protective boundaries:
   · They may not contact victims.
   · They receive help finding new housing (Baseline protection).
   · But they lose community belonging.

Important: Economic violence is real violence. It triggers the same protective response as physical violence.

---

PREVENTION: Building Immune Systems

Monthly questions for the Circle to ask:

1. "Does anyone feel financially pressured or obligated?"
2. "Are we keeping score without admitting it?"
3. "Are all contributions (money, labor, care) valued equally?"
4. "Can everyone say 'no' to a financial request without fear?"

Structural protections:

· Never put one person's name on all accounts. Always require two signatures for large withdrawals.
· Regular audits: Every 6 months, have an external Circle member review your Transparency Ledger.
· Exit fund: Maintain a small separate fund to help anyone who needs to leave quickly.

---

HEALING AFTER ECONOMIC HARM

If coercion has occurred and been addressed:

For victims:

1. Restoration of losses (if money was taken, it's returned).
2. Space to process without pressure to forgive.
3. Option to disengage from shared economy indefinitely.

For perpetrator (if they remain):

1. Full acknowledgment of harm without excuses.
2. Reparative actions (not punishment) – e.g., additional contributions to community fund.
3. Transparency: All their financial interactions are visible for a set period.
4. Education: Required participation in money culture workshops.

For the Circle:

1. Truth-telling circle: What did we miss? How did our system enable this?
2. Structural changes: Modify your economic model based on learnings.
3. Ritual of repair: A shared meal where the harm is acknowledged and new commitments are made.

---

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER FLOW DOCUMENTS

Remember: Your micro-economy doesn't exist in isolation.

When in doubt, consult:

· [AXIOMS.md] – Especially Axiom 1 (Non-Coercion) and Axiom 2 (Cognitive Ownership)
· [AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL.md] – For detecting drift into Mammon-logic
· [THE_HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL.md] – For serious cases
· [WEALTH_INEQUALITY_DAMPENING.md] – If historical wealth disparities are causing tension

---

FINAL REMINDER

Money is the last frontier of Mammon's programming.

We've been trained for centuries to:

· Hide our finances
· Compete for resources
· See generosity as weakness
· Measure worth by accumulation

Unlearning this takes time. Be patient. Be kind. But be vigilant.

The goal isn't perfect harmony. The goal is enough safety to struggle honestly.

When money conflicts arise (and they will), see them as opportunities: your Circle is being tested on whether it can handle reality. The protocols above are your tools.

Use them. Adapt them. Improve them.

And remember: A Circle that can survive money conflicts is a Circle that can survive anything.

Status: PRACTICAL ADDENDUM TO MICRO-ECONOMY GUIDE
Integration: Use alongside the three economic models
Principle: Clear process prevents covert power; boundaries protect the vulnerable.

### WEEK 1-4: Share one meal/week

Cook together.  
Split cost.  
Learn to collaborate.

### WEEK 5-8: Share one tool/resource

Lawn mower, car, washing machine.  
Practice lending/borrowing.

### WEEK 9-12: Pool for one expense

Maybe internet bill.  
Small amount.  
Low stakes.

### MONTH 4-6: Consider bigger sharing

If smaller experiments worked – maybe try rent sharing.

**If not – stay at current level.**

**There's no shame in partial sharing.**

---

## FINAL PRINCIPLE

**Money is Mammon's strongest weapon.**

It makes us:
- Compete
- Hoard
- Fear
- Judge

**Flow doesn't erase money overnight.**

**But it creates spaces where:**
- Sharing is normal
- Asking is okay
- Helping doesn't create debt
- Struggling doesn't mean exile

**Start small.** **Be honest.** **Be gentle with each other.**

**And remember:**

**Your worth is not your contribution.**
