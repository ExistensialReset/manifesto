### *Connecting the Architecture of Existential Reset*

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Audience:** Seekers · Builders · Architects · Translators  
**Function:** Orientation Map / Cognitive Spine

> **This is not another document.**  
> This is the **map that makes all other documents usable**.

Existential Reset is not a linear manifesto.  
It is an **ecosystem**.

This guide exists to help you *navigate* —  
from philosophical fire → to operational ground → to lived Flow.

## 🧭 HOW TO READ THIS GUIDE

- Read **top to bottom** if you are new  
- Jump to your **role section** if you are returning  
- Come back whenever the system feels “too big”

If something feels unclear:  
👉 you are probably standing *between* two documents.  
This guide shows you the bridges.

# 🔺 THE CORE TRINITY
### *The Non‑Negotiables*

These three documents form the **structural spine**.  
Nothing in the repository contradicts them.

---

## 🔥 MANIFESTO.md  
### *The Fire — Why Flow Exists*

- Establishes **existential diagnosis**
- Names Mammon as a system, not a villain
- Defines *Existential Sovereignty*

**Return to it when motivation fades.**

---

## 🛡️ PROTOCOL.md  
### *The Shield — How Harm Is Prevented*

- Defines **Baseline Security**
- Sets hard limits against coercion
- Explains why Flow is *not utopian anarchy*

**Read this when fear arises.**  
**Trust is built here.**

---

## 🧱 AXIOMS.md  
### *The Walls — What Cannot Be Violated*

- Non‑negotiable constraints
- Prevents Flow from mutating into ideology
- Protects minorities, children, and dissenters

**Read this when power is discussed.**  
**No exceptions live here.**

---

> 🔐 **Rule:**  
> If a proposal violates the Axioms, it does not proceed —  
> no matter how beautiful it sounds.

# 🧩 THE EXTENSION LAYER (/guides)
### *Contextual Intelligence*

These documents adapt the Core Trinity  
to **specific realities without diluting it**.

---

- Translate Flow into common objections  

**Use when:** explaining Flow to skeptics, family, institutions

---

## 📐 DEEP_MATH.md  
**Purpose:**  
- Quantify resource recovery  
- Show why Flow is *materially viable*  
- Anchor intuition in proof  

**Use when:** speaking to engineers, economists, policymakers

---

## 💰 MAMMONOLOGY / HYBRID_ECONOMY GUIDES  
**Purpose:**  
- Bridge Mammon-world ↔ Flow-world  
- Reduce dependency without self-harm  
- Remove guilt from hybrid living

# 🧠 ROLE-BASED NAVIGATION
### *Start Where You Stand*

You do **not** need to read everything.

| You are mainly a… | Start Here | Then Expand To |
|------------------|-----------|---------------|
| 🌱 **Seeker** | MANIFESTO.md | FAQ → Mammonology |
| 🛠️ **Builder / Organizer** | PROTOCOL.md | AXIOMS → FLOW_PILOT_PROTOCOL |
| 📊 **Engineer / Economist** | DEEP_MATH.md | PROTOCOL → TECHNICAL ANNEX |
| 🧑‍💻 **Tech Architect** | FLOW_SRS.md | TECHNICAL_ANNEX → PROTOCOL |
| 🌍 **Cultural Translator** | GLOBAL_RESONANCE_GUIDE | AXIOMS → MANIFESTO |

> 🌀 **Design Principle:**  
> No reader should ever feel stupid or overwhelmed.  
> Orientation is care.

# ✖️ THE UNIFYING FORMULA
### *Why All This Exists*

Every document optimizes the same equation:

## **Life = L × S × I**

Where:

- **L — Calm (Lugn):**  
  Achieved through Baseline Security  
- **S — Spontaneity:**  
  Released when debt & fear recede  
- **I — Insight (Inkännande):**  
  Grows when attention becomes sovereign  

If a document increases one value while collapsing another:  
⚠️ it must be revised.

---

# 🔄 HOW DOCUMENTS TALK TO EACH OTHER

- MANIFESTO defines *truth*
- AXIOMS define *limits*
- PROTOCOL defines *safety*
- GUIDES define *application*
- PILOTS generate *feedback*
- TENSIONS document *where reality bites back*

Nothing is final.  
Everything is accountable.

---

# 🌱 FINAL ORIENTATION PRINCIPLE

> **This is a modular system, not a doctrine.**  
> Fork what you need.  
> Adapt to context.  
> Protect the Baseline.  
> Document honestly.  
> Feed learnings back.

---

## 🕊️ LAST LINE (READ THIS TWICE)

**Flow does not demand belief.  
It invites participation.**

Build gently.  
Think clearly.  
Care fiercely.
