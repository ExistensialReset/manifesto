# INTEGRATION_GUIDE: Connecting the Architecture

This document explains how the various components of the Existential Reset ecosystem interconnect. It serves as a map for both seekers and builders to navigate between philosophical truth and logistical execution.

---

## 1. The Core Trinity
These are the foundational documents of the repository.

* **MANIFESTO.md**: The Philosophical Truth (The Fire). Start here to understand *why*.
* **PROTOCOL.md**: The Operational Machinery (The Shield). Read this to understand *how* the Baseline is protected.
* **AXIOMS.md**: The Ontological Boundaries (The Walls). The non-negotiable laws that prevent oppression.

---

## 2. The Expansion Guides (/guides)
Use these documents to deepen your understanding or apply the Reset in specific contexts.

* **FAQ.md**: Addresses common objections and legacy-system fears with logistical logic.
* **DEEP_MATH.md**: Provides the mathematical proofs, simulations, and efficiency calculations (25.5% recovery).
* **MAMMONOLOGY_GUIDE.md**: A practical roadmap for individuals to transition from debt-based systems to Flow.

## 3. Mapping for Specific Groups
Depending on your role, focus on these connections:

| If you are a... | Focus on... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Seeker** | `MANIFESTO.md` + `MAMMONOLOGY_GUIDE.md` |
| **Engineer/Economist** | `PROTOCOL.md` + `DEEP_MATH.md` |
| **Organizer/Builder** | `AXIOMS.md` + `FAQ.md` |
| **Tech Innovator** | `FLOW_SRS.md` + `TECHNICAL_ANNEX.md` |

## 4. The Goal: L × S × I
Every document in this repository is designed to maximize the formula:
**Life = Calm (L) × Spontaneity (S) × Insight (I)**

* **Calm** is achieved through **Baseline Security**.
* **Spontaneity** is released through **Debt Nullification**.
* **Insight** is cultivated through **Sovereign Attention**.

**THE SYSTEM IS MODULAR BUT CONSISTENT. FORK THE MODELS, BUILD THE CIRCLES, PROTECT THE FLOW.**
