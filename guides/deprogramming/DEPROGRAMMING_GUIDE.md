# DEPROGRAMMING GUIDE: Gentle Unlearning of Mammon-Logic

**Status:** Living support text (non-binding)  
**Purpose:** Offer orientation for noticing and loosening internalized scarcity, performance, and earning logic.  

*This guide is not a program. It is not a cure, ladder, or timeline. Nothing here must be completed or “work.” You owe this guide nothing.*

## §1. HOW MAMMON CAN LIVE ON INSIDE US

Mammon-logic often remains as tone, tension, reflex, or background noise, even after intellectual rejection.  
These patterns are **traces of long adaptation**, not flaws.

### 1.1 The Hustle Echo
- Rest that carries guilt  
- Leisure that feels watched  
- Days that feel “wrong” when nothing measurable happens  
- Minds that keep running after the body is tired  

Nothing is broken — the body has learned survival under earned safety.

### 1.2 When Worth Quietly Equals Output
- Self-respect rises and falls with productivity  
- Praise feels uncomfortable unless justified  
- Recognition triggers anxiety  
- Subtle sense that existence needs ongoing proof  

This is often subconscious, a learned identity habit.

### 1.3 The Background Fear of “Not Enough”
- Holding on despite having enough  
- Preparing for loss that never comes  
- Feeling fragile without clear cause  
- Anxiety around money, food, or security even in safety  

This is **not pessimism**, just a nervous system conditioned by artificial scarcity.

## §2. ORIENTING BACK TO BASELINE

No fixing required — just gentle invitations to notice reality.

### 2.1 Noticing What Is Already Secured
- Sit or stand quietly  
- Let eyes rest  
- Notice: air, ground, safety  

No convincing needed; just observation is enough.

### 2.2 Time Without Purpose
- Walk without destination  
- Watch light, clouds, or rain  
- Sit without planning, improving, or learning  

The body experiences time that asks nothing in return — even resistance is allowed.

## §3. WHEN THE OLD VOICE SPEAKS

Internal phrases like *“I should be doing something useful”* may appear.  

Try noticing gently:
- Pause for a breath  
- Ask: Is this my voice, or a borrowed one?  
- Notice what happens if nothing is done  

Fading or persistent — both are fine.

---

## §4. IDENTITY, LOOSENED

Some identities were formed in exchange-based environments.  
Notice roles tied to earning, proving, or producing.  
Ask: What deeper qualities were these protecting?  

These core qualities often remain when performance identities soften.

---

## §5. WITH OTHERS

Social reinforcement can sustain Mammon-logic — but it can loosen socially too.  
Small, non-performative gatherings matter:
- Share experience without analysis  
- Listen without fixing  
- Nothing needs to be impressive  

---

## §6. RECEIVING WITHOUT BALANCE

The need to immediately return value is common.  
Try noticing:  
- Compliments, cups of tea, small kindnesses  
- Nothing given back, no explanation needed  
- Discomfort is information, not failure  

---

## §7. WHEN OLD PATTERNS RETURN

They often do:  
- Quiet self-comparison  
- Tracking effort or worth  
- Dreams of falling behind  
- Dismissing rest  

This is **not failure**; patterns are learned slowly.

---

## §8. ORIENTATION, NOT PROGRESS

Gentle questions for reflection, not tests:
- Can rest exist without justification?  
- Can beauty exist without usefulness?  
- Can not-knowing be tolerated without shame?  
- Can help be received without repayment?  

No goals — just noticing life as it meets you now.

---

## §9. A LONG VIEW

Unlearning unfolds unevenly:  
- Early periods: disorienting  
- Later: quieter  
- Old reflexes may return unexpectedly  

No linearity, no pace — only gradual growth toward baseline understanding: existence itself does **not** need permission.

**Final Note:**  
If this guide feels heavy, close it. Flow does not require understanding. Your humanity was never conditional. You are allowed to be here — without earning it.
