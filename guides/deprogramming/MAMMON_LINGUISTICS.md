# 🗣️ MAMMON_LINGUISTICS.md: De-colonizing the Inner Conversation

**Status:** ACTIVE DEPROGRAMMING 🔓  
**Purpose:** Identifying and erasing extractive language to make space for life’s frequency.

## §1. THE DEBT AND CALCULATION TRAP

Mammon uses words to create an illusion of debt and ownership where there should only be flow.

| Mammon-Logic | Life’s Resonance/Flow language 
L x S x I | The Shift |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"I owe you"** | *"I receive your gift"* | Guilt-based debt vs. Heart-based resonance. |
| **"Calculating"** | *"Attuning / Sensing"* | Life is not a budget; it’s an organic pulse. |
| **"Invest time"** | *"Dedicate presence"* | Time is the space we breathe in, not a capital for return. |
| **"Time is money"** | *"Time is Life"* | Reclaiming rest from being seen as a "cost." |

## §2. EXPLODING THE "POVERTY" MYTH

> *"Time is the only thing a poor person has."*

This phrase is a weapon of Mammon. It devalues human existence by suggesting that time is a "lesser" resource than money. 
* **The Reality:** Time is existence itself. To own one's time is the ultimate sovereignty. 
* **The Correction:** We do not "have" time; we *are* time.

## §3. REPLACING EXTRACTIVE METAPHORS ⚡

Notice when you speak of yourself as a machine or a resource:

- **"I'm running out of energy"** (Battery logic)  
  → *Try:* "I need stillness" or "The field requires rest."
- **"What’s the ROI (Return on Investment)?"** (Transactional thinking)  
  → *Try:* "How does the resonance (I) feel in this meeting?"
- **"I have to earn my rest"** (Debt logic)  
  → *Try:* "I am returning to Baseline (L)."

## §4. THE GENTLE RE-FORMULATION

1. **Erase "Should/Must":** Mammon loves the language of obligation. Replace it with *"I choose"* or *"I feel called to."*
2. **Honor "Nothing":** Mammon hates silence because it cannot be sold. Reclaim the word "nothing" as a state of pure being.
3. **From Debt to Flow:** Instead of "I'm in your debt," try "I witness and honor your kindness."

## §5. THE CORE METRIC: L x S x I

- **L (Calm):** Talk about *Safety* (internal) instead of *Security* (fences).
- **S (Spontaneity):** Talk about *Play* instead of *Creative Output*.
- **I (Empathy):** Talk about *Resonance* instead of *Networking*.
