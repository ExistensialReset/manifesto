INTRODUCTION: GLOBAL NEURODIVERSITY IS NOT A DEFICIT
The Node
In this document, we use the term Node. Every neurodivergent person is a unique, valuable point in a global network—a nervous system, a society, a community. A node receives and sends signals, connects across cultures, and holds strength in authenticity and lived experience. We are all nodes in the network.
Mammon Systems (Global Expression)
Extractive systems pathologize difference to maximize productivity, but this appears differently worldwide:
 * Western contexts: “You can’t sit still for 8 hours? You’re broken.”
 * East Asian contexts: “You disrupt group harmony.”
 * Global South contexts: “You can’t work consistently? You’re lazy.”
Flow Response
No. The environment adapts to the node. Neurodivergence is a natural variation in human cognition—not a disease. This includes ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and more, often overlapping with trauma or chronic illness.
Purpose: To create culturally adaptive environments where all nodes can thrive.
§0.5 NEURODIVERGENCE AS EXISTENTIAL SOVEREIGNTY IMPLEMENTATION 🌀
Neurodivergence is not a bug in the Mammon system. It is a feature of the Flow system.
Life Quality Equation (Flow Mathematics)
Where, for neurodivergent nodes:
 * L (Calm/Lugn): Baseline guarantee + sensory safety + cultural acceptance
 * S (Spontaneity): Authentic expression − masking effort − cultural conformity pressure
 * I (Innate Empathy/Inkännande): Reciprocity and mutual regulation within Flow Circles
You Are Implementing Global Existential Sovereignty When You:
 * Claim your Baseline as non-negotiable (food, housing, care), regardless of cultural pressure.
 * Build your Flow Core (3–7 people who understand your nervous system).
 * Identify and reduce your Cultural Mammon Friction Score.
 * Use decision trees and external scaffolding during executive dysfunction.
 * Treat special interests as sovereignty acts—reclaiming attention from extractive systems.
Cultural Intelligence in Neurodivergent Support
| Region / Context | Common Challenges | Flow Adaptation |
|---|---|---|
| Western | Over-pathologization | Environmental adaptation |
| East Asian | Conformity pressure | Safe authenticity within harmony |
| Global South | Resource scarcity | Community-based support |
| Indigenous | Different frameworks | Integrate traditional knowledge |
§1. ADHD ACROSS CULTURES
 * 1.1 Global Context: Hyperactivity is recognized more in Western cultures, while Inattentive ADHD is often misunderstood elsewhere. It is frequently moralized or spiritualized.
 * 1.2 Practices: Structure work around interest, allow movement, and enable body doubling. Adapt to cultural norms (direct vs. indirect communication).
 * 1.3 Medication: Optional. Never mandatory. Most effective when paired with environmental support.
§2. AUTISM SPECTRUM WORLDWIDE
 * 2.1 Cultural Understandings: Ranges from the Medical deficit model (West) to family responsibility (East Asia) and "Different way of being" (Indigenous).
 * 2.2 Flow Practices: Sensory adaptation, clear communication, reduced masking, and respect for routines.
 * 2.3 Special Interests: These function as cultural preservation, innovation engines, and bridges between communities.
 * 2.4 Masking & Burnout: Masking + cultural conformity = double load. Flow creates spaces for multiple authenticities.
§3. TRAUMA (PTSD / C-PTSD): GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES
 * 3.1 Cultural Trauma: We recognize individual, collective, intergenerational, and displacement trauma.
 * 3.2 Trauma-Informed Flow: Safety before productivity. Consent over disclosure. Regulation over explanation.
 * 3.3 Responses: Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn—all valid nervous system strategies.
§4. CHRONIC ILLNESS & DISABILITY WORLDWIDE
 * 4.1 Models: Flow integrates medical, social, cultural, and spiritual models while centering lived experience.
 * 4.2 Energy-Based Participation: * Spoon Theory adapted to economic context.
   * Asynchronous participation.
   * Rest as a right.
§5. OTHER NEURODIVERGENT CONDITIONS
 * 5.1 Dyslexia: Language-specific challenges; Flow supports multimodal input/output.
 * 5.2 OCD: Culturally shaped obsessions; Flow provides structure without coercion.
 * 5.3 Cultural Expressions: Unnamed experiences remain valid and recognized.
§6. INTERSECTIONALITY & GLOBAL CONTEXTS
Neurodivergence intersects with Culture, Class, Gender, Migration, and Geography. Flow centers marginalized voices and resists Western dominance.
§7. NEURODIVERGENT CHILDREN ACROSS CULTURES
Focus on play-based learning, family-system support, community involvement, and cultural continuity.
§8. COMMON PITFALLS
 * Cultural imperialism.
 * Ignoring stigma.
 * Assuming universality.
 * Over-medicalization.
§9. PRINCIPLE: ADAPTATION, NOT ASSIMILATION
> Motto: “Your culture is not your enemy. Oppressive systems are.”
> 
§10. GLOBAL CHECKLIST FOR FLOW CIRCLES
 * [ ] Cultural intelligence & language accessibility.
 * [ ] Economic accessibility.
 * [ ] Sensory adaptation.
 * [ ] Local resource mapping.
 * [ ] Global knowledge sharing.
§11. GLOBAL RESOURCES
 * WHO: Global Mental Health
 * UNESCO: Inclusive Education
 * ASAN: Global Advocacy
 * ADHD Europe
§12. LIVING DOCUMENT 🔄
This is a living global document. Translation, adaptation, and critique are welcomed.
§13. WELCOME TO FLOW: FIRST STEPS FOR A NEW NODE 🌍
 * Identify cultural context.
 * Secure baseline with dignity.
 * Balance global knowledge and local support.
 * Practice cultural authenticity.
Welcome to the Global Flow Network.
GLOBAL PRINCIPLES DECLARATION
 * Neurodiversity is universal, yet culturally expressed.
 * No single model fits all.
 * Center marginalized voices.
 * Decolonize neurodiversity knowledge.
 * Practice global solidarity with local adaptation.
STATUS: Global neurodivergent protocol active
VALIDATION: Trauma-informed, culturally grounded
COMMITMENT: All cultures welcome
🌍🧠🕊️✨
Many cultures. One neurohumanity.
Would you like me to:
 * Create a specific Decision Tree for executive dysfunction to include in §0.5?
 * Expand on the Cultural Mammon Friction Score and how to calculate it?
 * Prepare a summary of this document to share with new nodes in the network?
