INTRODUCTION: GLOBAL NEURODIVERSITY IS NOT A DEFICIT

The Node: In this document, we use the term "Node." Why?

Every neurodivergent person is a unique, valuable point in a global network – a nervous system, a society, a community. A node receives and sends signals, has links to others across cultures, and its strength lies in authenticity and its specific hub of experiences. We are all nodes in the network.

Mammon systems worldwide (extractive capitalist structures) pathologize differences to maximize productivity, but express this differently across cultures:

In Western contexts: "You can't sit still for 8 hours? You're broken."
In East Asian contexts: "You don't conform to group harmony? You're disruptive."
In Global South contexts: "You can't perform manual labor consistently? You're lazy."

Flow says: No. The environment adapts to the node. Neurodivergence represents natural variations in brain function – not diseases. It includes ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and more, often overlapping with trauma or chronic illness.

Purpose: Create culturally adaptive, inclusive environments where all nodes can thrive globally.

§0.5 NEURODIVERGENCE AS EXISTENTIAL SOVEREIGNTY IMPLEMENTATION 🌀

Your neurodivergence is not a bug in the Mammon system – it's a feature of the Flow system.

The Global Mathematics of Neurodivergent Flow

```
Life Quality (LQ) = L × S × I
Where for neurodivergent nodes:
L (Calm) = Baseline guarantee + sensory safety + cultural acceptance
S (Spontaneity) = Authentic expression - masking effort - cultural conformity pressure
I (Innate Empathy) = Reciprocity in Flow Circles across cultural boundaries
```

You Are Implementing Global Existential Sovereignty When You:

1. Claim your Baseline as non-negotiable (food, housing, care) regardless of cultural expectations
2. Build your Global Flow Core (3-7 people who understand your nervous system across cultures)
3. Calculate your Cultural Mammon Friction Score and systematically reduce it
4. Use the Decision Tree Protocol for executive dysfunction moments across different cultural contexts
5. See your special interests as sovereignty acts – reclaiming attention from extractive systems worldwide

Cultural Intelligence in Neurodivergent Support:

Region/Culture Common Challenges Flow Adaptations
Western Individualistic Over-pathologization, medication-first approach Emphasize environmental adaptation, community support
East Asian Collectivist Pressure for conformity, masking as duty Create safe spaces for authenticity within group harmony
Global South/Global Majority Resource scarcity, stigma, lack of diagnosis Focus on practical adaptations, community-based support
Indigenous Communities Different conceptualizations of neurodivergence Integrate traditional knowledge with neurodiversity paradigm

§1. ADHD ACROSS CULTURES (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder)

1.1 ADHD in Global Flow Context

Cultural variations in ADHD expression:

· Western contexts: Hyperactivity more recognized
· Asian contexts: Inattentive type more common (often misunderstood as "daydreaming")
· Latin American contexts: Often attributed to "nervios" or spiritual causes
· African contexts: May be seen as behavioral issue rather than neurological

Universal Flow response: Structure work around interests, allow movement and multiple projects. Body Doubling and visual schedules boost focus.

1.2 Culturally Adapted ADHD Practices

· Meeting structures that respect cultural time perceptions (flexible vs. punctual)
· Movement allowances that don't violate cultural norms (subtle fidgeting vs. obvious movement)
· Communication styles adapted to cultural expectations (direct vs. indirect)
· Family involvement appropriate to cultural family structures

1.3 Medication Across Cultures

· Western approach: Often medication-first
· European approach: More environmental adaptations
· Asian contexts: Stigma around psychiatric medication
· Flow principle: Medication optional, never mandatory. Combine with environmental support.

1.4 Global Resource Mapping for ADHD

```
ADHD Support = Local Resources + Global Knowledge + Cultural Adaptation
```

§2. AUTISM SPECTRUM WORLDWIDE

2.1 Autism in Cultural Context

Cultural variations in autism understanding:

· Western medical model: Spectrum, deficits-focused
· East Asian: Often hidden, family responsibility
· Global South: May be seen through spiritual/religious lens
· Indigenous: Sometimes recognized as different way of being

Flow approach: Celebrate neurocognitive diversity while providing necessary support.

2.2 Cultural Adaptation of Autism Support

· Communication styles: Adapt to cultural communication norms
· Social expectations: Balance cultural social demands with autistic needs
· Family systems: Work with extended family structures where relevant
· Community integration: Find culturally appropriate ways to participate

2.3 Special Interests as Cultural Bridges

Special interests can:

· Preserve cultural knowledge (history, traditions)
· Innovate within cultural contexts
· Bridge cultural gaps through shared passions

2.4 Masking & Cultural Conformity

The double burden:

· Masking neurodivergent traits
· PLUS masking cultural differences (for immigrants/minorities)

Flow solution: Create spaces where multiple authenticities can coexist.

§3. TRAUMA (PTSD/C-PTSD) GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES

3.1 Trauma in Cultural Context

Cultural variations in trauma:

· Individualistic cultures: Focus on personal trauma
· Collectivist cultures: Collective trauma, intergenerational trauma

3.2 Culturally Informed Trauma Practices

· Safety definitions that respect cultural boundaries
· Healing practices that integrate cultural traditions
· Community support appropriate to cultural community structures
· Storytelling in culturally appropriate ways

3.3 Global Trauma Responses

Recognize that trauma responses are expressed differently across cultures:

· Somatization in some cultures
· Spiritual experiences in others
· Collective rather than individual symptoms

§4. CHRONIC ILLNESS & DISABILITY WORLDWIDE

4.1 Disability Justice Across Cultures

Cultural models of disability:

· Medical model (Western): Individual deficit
· Social model: Societal barriers
· Cultural model: Varies by cultural interpretation

Flow integrates all models while centering the node's experience.

4.2 Spoon Theory in Different Economic Contexts

· High-income countries: More resources but higher expectations
· Low-income countries: Fewer resources but different expectations
· Flow adaptation: Flexible participation, async options, energy-based planning

4.3 Accessibility as Cultural Practice

· Physical accessibility varies by infrastructure
· Digital accessibility varies by technology access
· Social accessibility varies by cultural norms
