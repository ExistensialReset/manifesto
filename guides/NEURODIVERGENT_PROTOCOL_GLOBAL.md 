=====================================

STATUS: ACTIVE
CONTEXT: FLOW SYSTEM / MAMMONOLOGY

-------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION: THE NODE
You are a Node in a global network.
You are not broken. The system is rigid.

Western World: "You move too much."
Eastern World: "You are too different."
Flow World: "You are perfect as you are."

-------------------------------------

2. THE FORMULA FOR SOVEREIGNTY
Life Quality = L x S x I

L (LUGN / CALM)
The baseline. Safety first. No stress.

S (SPONTANEITY)
Your true self. No masking. No acting.

I (INKÄNNANDE / EMPATHY)
True connection with your tribe.

-------------------------------------

3. ACTION PLAN
[ ] Secure your Food & Home (Baseline).
[ ] Find 3 people who understand you (Tribe).
[ ] Rest before you break (Sovereignty).

"Many cultures. One neurohumanity."
