## 1. INTRODUCTION: GLOBAL NEURODIVERSITY

### The Node
In this protocol, a human being is referred to as a **Node**. 
A node is not a broken part of a machine; it is a unique, sensing point in a global network. A node holds strength in authenticity, signal sensitivity, and lived experience. **We are all nodes.**

### The Enemy: Mammon Systems
Extractive systems ("Mammon") pathologize difference to maximize short-term productivity. This oppression shifts shape across cultures:

* **🇺🇸 Western Contexts:** *"You are broken because you cannot sit still for 8 hours."* (Pathologizing Motion)
* **🇯🇵 East Asian Contexts:** *"You are selfish because you disrupt group harmony."* (Pathologizing Individualism)
* **🌍 Global South Contexts:** *"You are lazy because your energy is inconsistent."* (Pathologizing Survival)

### The Flow Response
**The environment must adapt to the Node.** Neurodivergence (ADHD, Autism, OCD, etc.) is a natural variation in human cognition. It is a feature of the Flow system, essential for innovation and sensing.

## 2. THE CORE EQUATION & SOVEREIGNTY 🌀

We calculate the Existential Sovereignty of a node using the **Flow Life Quality Equation**.

$$Life = L \times S \times I$$

Where:

* **L = LUGN (Calm):** The baseline. Biological safety, sensory protection, and freedom from "fight or flight."
* **S = SPONTANEITY:** The ability to act authentically without "masking." (Low Mammon Friction).
* **I = INKÄNNANDE (Innate Empathy):** Deep resonance and mutual regulation with other nodes in a Flow Circle.

### 🛠 Implementation Steps
1.  **Secure the Baseline:** Food, shelter, and rest are non-negotiable rights, not rewards.
2.  **Reduce Friction:** Identify where culture scrapes against your nervous system.
3.  **Build the Core:** Surround yourself with 3–7 nodes who understand your signal.

## 3. CULTURAL INTELLIGENCE FRAMEWORK

Different cultures require different adaptations to achieve Flow.

| Region / Context | The Challenge (Mammon) | The Fix (Flow) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Western** (Individualist) | Over-medicalization & stigma | **Environmental Design:** Change the office, not the brain. |
| **East Asian** (Collectivist) | Pressure to conform/mask | **Safe Pockets:** Create micro-communities for unmasked authenticity. |
| **Global South** (Resource Constrained) | Scarcity & Survival mode | **Community Support:** Share resources to lower the collective baseline stress. |
| **Indigenous** (Traditional) | Colonial erasure of wisdom | **Integration:** Frame neurodivergence through traditional roles (e.g., the Seer/Shaman). |

## 4. CONDITION-SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS

### ⚡ ADHD: The Hunters
* **Reframing:** You are not distracted; you are scanning for high-value targets.
* **Protocol:** Work in bursts (sprints). Use body doubling (working alongside another node). 
* **Motto:** *"Follow the dopamine trail to the truth."*

### 🧩 AUTISM: The Architects
* **Reframing:** You are not rigid; you are a system optimizer.
* **Protocol:** Explicit communication. Sensory control is mandatory. Special interests are "Innovation Engines."
* **Motto:** *"Truth over politeness. Pattern over chaos."*

### ❤️ TRAUMA (C-PTSD): The Sentinels
* **Reframing:** Your hypervigilance is a skill, but it needs an "off switch."
* **Protocol:** Safety is the prerequisite for all work. **Rest is a human right.**
* **Motto:** *"Heal the root, and the tree will grow."*

## 5. GLOBAL PRINCIPLES & RESOURCES

### The "Flow Node" Checklist
- [ ] **Identity:** Do I define myself, or does Mammon define me?
- [ ] **Tribe:** Do I have a circle where I don't have to explain my brain?
- [ ] **Rest:** Did I rest *before* I broke?

### 🌍 Declaration of Interdependence
1.  **Adaptation, not Assimilation.**
2.  **Your culture is your context, not your cage.**
3.  **We move together, or we do not move at all.**

> *"Many cultures. One neurohumanity."*
