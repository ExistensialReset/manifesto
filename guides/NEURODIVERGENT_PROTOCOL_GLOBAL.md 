The environment must adapt to the Node.
​2. THE FORMULA
​Life = L x S x I
​L (Calm): Safety first.
S (Spontaneity): Authentic self.
I (Empathy): True connection.
​3. ACTION
​Secure Baseline (Food, shelter, rest).
​Find Tribe (3-7 safe people).
​Unmask (Be your weird self).
​"Many cultures. One neurohumanity."
