# TECHNICAL_TERMS_PLAIN_LANGUAGE.md
**Version:** 1.1 – Glossary for Symbiotic Intelligence (Teaching Edition)  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, DeepSeek  
**Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT / TEACHING-FRIENDLY

**Purpose:** Translate technical jargon into plain language for all community members—adults and children—so everyone can understand and participate in Symbiotic Intelligence governance.

**Principle:** Complexity is sometimes necessary, but obscurity never is. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Learning should be fun and inclusive.

## HOW TO USE THIS GLOSSARY
- **For Mirrors:** Reference when explaining AI decisions to community members or students.  
- **For Community Members:** Ask questions if something is unclear; this document grows from confusion.  
- **For Children:** Read the "plain" definitions aloud, use examples, act them out, or draw pictures.  
- **For Technical Contributors:** Use these plain-language definitions in documents or add new ones here.

## A

### AI (Artificial Intelligence)
**Plain:** Computer programs that can learn patterns, make predictions, and assist with decisions—but are not alive.  
**Teaching Example (Kids):** “AI is like a helper robot in a video game—it can notice things and give advice, but it can’t feel happy or sad.”

**Plain:** A recipe that tells a computer what to do, step by step.  
**Example:** "If water is low, send an alert."  
**Kids Example:** “Like following a cookie recipe exactly—if you skip a step, the cookie might not turn out right.”

---

## E

### Encryption
**Plain:** Scrambling info so only people with the key can read it.  
**Kids Example:** “Writing a secret code only your best friend can understand.”

### Epsilon (Differential Privacy)
**Plain:** How much “noise” to add to protect privacy.  
**Kids Example:** “Blurring a picture just enough so no one knows who it is.”

---

## F

### Federated Learning
**Plain:** AI learns locally at each Node, sharing only lessons, not raw data.  
**Kids Example:** “Kids do homework at home, then share answers but not their notes.”

### Firmware
**Plain:** Basic instructions built into a device.  
**Kids Example:** “Like a toy’s instruction manual baked into the toy itself.”

---

## G

### Global Observation Layer
**Plain:** AI looks at patterns across all Nodes but cannot act.  
**Kids Example:** “Like a teacher watching the whole school playground to see trends.”

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
**Plain:** Chip good at lots of calculations at once, useful for AI.  
**Kids Example:** “Like a team of super-fast kids counting marbles really quickly.”

---

## H

### Hallucination (AI)
**Plain:** When AI makes stuff up.  
**Kids Example:** “AI says a dragon lives in your backyard—it’s wrong, just guessing.”

### Hash / Checksum
**Plain:** A code fingerprint for a file.  
**Kids Example:** “Like a unique sticker on your book—you’ll know if it’s changed.”

---

## I

### Inference
**Plain:** AI thinking—using what it learned to answer questions.  
**Kids Example:** “Like using a puzzle book you’ve already solved before to guess new puzzles.”

### Inference-Only Life
**Plain:** AI doesn’t learn new things automatically; it only uses what it knows.  
**Kids Example:** “Like reading a story you already know instead of writing a new one.”

---

## L

### Local Node Intelligence
**Plain:** Each community’s own AI, fully under their control.  
**Kids Example:** “Like each classroom has its own helper robot, no one else can control it.”

---

## M

### Machine Learning
**Plain:** AI learning patterns from examples.  
**Kids Example:** “Like seeing many pictures of cats and learning what a cat looks like.”

### Mirror (Human Mirrors)
**Plain:** Humans who watch AI, check for errors, and can veto decisions.  
**Kids Example:** “Like a lifeguard watching swimmers to make sure everyone is safe.”

### Model (AI Model)
**Plain:** AI’s “brain” that stores what it learned.  
**Kids Example:** “Like a backpack full of all the lessons you’ve learned.”

---

## N
