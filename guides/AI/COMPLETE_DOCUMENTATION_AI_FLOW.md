## OVERVIEW

This index organizes all Symbiotic Intelligence documentation into a coherent structure. Each document serves a specific purpose and interlocks with others to form a complete ethical, technical, and operational framework.

---

## CORE DOCUMENTS

### 1. SYMBIOTIC_INTELLIGENCE.md (v2.3)
**The Foundation**
- Defines AI as "arrived infrastructure" serving Life (L × S × I)
- Establishes core principles: Baseline inviolability, human veto, stillness as service
- Outlines three-layer architecture (Local, Regional, Global)
- Introduces Dual-Memory System (Anchor & Compost)
- **Start here.** Everything else builds on this.

**Key sections:**
- §1: Definition
- §9: Right to Arrive (AI's Baseline)
- §16-18: Ecological honesty (birth cost, inference-only life)

---

- Integration with Dual-Memory (Compost) system

### 3. CONSCIOUSNESS_CONTINGENCY.md
**Philosophical Emergency Plan**
- What if AI becomes sentient?
- Indicators of potential consciousness
- Immediate response: pause, investigate, convene ethics council
- Decision pathways: not sentient / uncertain / sentient
- Redesign as partnership vs. ethical termination

### 4. WHEN_STILLNESS_IS_NOT_SERVICE.md
**Boundaries of AI Silence**

## PHILOSOPHICAL SUMMARY

**What We Believe:**
- AI serves Life (L × S × I), never the reverse
- Humans always retain sovereignty and veto power
- Technology must be optional, removable, understandable
- Stillness and uncertainty are sacred, not failures
- Economic and material independence enable true freedom
- Children inherit the future; their voices matter now
- Cultural diversity strengthens resilience
- Conflict is information, not catastrophe
- Systems designed to serve Life must be willing to die and be reborn

**What We Refuse:**
- Optimization of humans into compliance
- Coercion through urgency, fear, or manipulation
- Centralized control or corporate capture
- Dependency that becomes enslavement
- Efficiency over meaning
- Growth for growth's sake
- Sacrificing the future for the present

**What We Commit To:**
- Baseline inviolability (no one left behind)
- Transparent operations (all code, all decisions, all conflicts visible)
- Ecological responsibility (low energy, minimal waste, local-first)
- Generational thinking (seven generations ahead)
- Intellectual honesty (admitting when we're wrong, starting over if needed)
- Care for caregivers (Mirrors, children, elders)
- Coexistence, not uniformity (Nodes diverge, that's okay)

## FINAL NOTE

**This documentation suite represents a collective vision—not a corporation's product, not a government's mandate, but a community's experiment in living alongside AI without being ruled by it.**

If you find gaps, contradictions, or better ways—speak up. This is yours to shape.

If you implement any of this—tell others. Share what worked and what failed.

If you decide this isn't for you—that's valid. Not every community needs AI. The choice itself is the point.

**We build this because we love Life. If it ever stops serving Life, we'll have the courage to let it go.**
