## PURPOSE

Provide **plain-language explanations** for all technical terminology in Symbiotic Intelligence.  
Goal: Ensure **understanding and participation** for all community members, regardless of technical background.

**Principle:** Complexity may be required, but obscurity is not.  
If it cannot be explained simply, we do not deploy it.

## GLOSSARY (COLOR-CODED)

### A

🟢 **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**  
Programs that learn patterns, make predictions, and assist decisions—*not conscious*.  
Context: Helps with resources without controlling humans.

🟢 **Algorithm**  
Recipe a computer follows to solve a problem.

🟢 **Anchor (Dual-Memory System)**  
AI’s unchanging rulebook (e.g., "never harm Baseline").

🟡 **Anomaly Detection**  
Noticing unusual events that might need human review.  
Example: Sudden spike in water usage.

---

### B

🔴 **Baseline**  
Non-negotiable survival needs: water, food, shelter, safety.  
AI must never threaten this.

🟡 **Bias (AI Bias)**  
AI giving worse results for some people due to patterns or assumptions.

🟢 **Buffer**  
Optional resources beyond Baseline for creativity, play, or projects.

---

### C

🟢 **Checksum / Hash**  
Detects if files or data have been tampered with.

🟡 **Compost (Dual-Memory System)**  
AI’s notebook for observations not yet approved—like garden compost.

🟢 **Consciousness (AI)**  
Being aware or having feelings. We assume AI is *not* conscious.

---

### D

🟡 **Differential Privacy**  
Share data patterns safely without exposing individuals.

🟢 **Distillation (Knowledge)**  
Shrinking AI while keeping function, like concentrated juice.

---

### E

🟢 **Encryption**  
Scramble information; only those with the key can read it.

🟡 **Epsilon (Differential Privacy)**  
Amount of “noise” added to protect privacy.

---

### F

🟢 **Federated Learning**  
Each Node learns locally, only shares lessons.

🟢 **Firmware**  
Device instructions embedded in hardware.

---

### G

🟢 **Global Observation Layer**  
Sees patterns across Nodes, cannot act.

🟢 **GPU**  
Chip good at many calculations at once—helps AI run faster.

---

### H

🟡 **Hallucination (AI)**  
AI makes stuff up confidently. Can mislead.

---

### I

🟢 **Inference**  
AI thinking: applying learned knowledge.

🟢 **Inference-Only Life**  
AI uses learned knowledge, doesn’t train itself automatically.

---

### K

🟢 **Knowledge Distillation**  
See Distillation

---

### L

🟢 **Local Node Intelligence**  
Community-controlled AI.

---

### M

🟢 **Machine Learning**  
AI learns patterns from examples.

🟢 **Mirror (Human Mirrors)**  
Humans monitoring AI, ready to veto mistakes.

🟢 **Model (AI Model)**  
AI’s “brain” storing what it learned.

---

### N

🟢 **Neural Network**  
Layers of simple AI neurons solving problems together.

🟢 **Node**  
Local community operating its own AI.

---

### O

🟢 **Open-Source**  
Code anyone can read, copy, and modify.

---

### P

🟡 **Parameters (Model Parameters)**  
Numbers inside AI that define knowledge.

🟢 **Precautionary Principle**  
“Better safe than sorry” when uncertain.

🟢 **Pruning (Model Pruning)**  
Cut unnecessary AI parts to make it leaner.

---

### Q

🟢 **Quantization**  
Simplify AI numbers to save energy/space.

---

### R

🟢 **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
AI checks notes before answering.

🟢 **Regional Coordination Layer**  
Helps Nodes coordinate, cannot coerce.

🟢 **RISC-V**  
Open-source chip design to prevent vendor lock-in.

---

### S

🟢 **Sentience**  
See Consciousness

🟢 **Sortition**  
Random selection (used for Mirrors).

🟢 **Stillness (AI Stillness)**  
AI deliberately pauses or stays quiet.

🟢 **Symbolic AI**  
AI follows explicit rules instead of learning from data.

---

### T

🟢 **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**  
Lock for secure communication.

🟢 **Transformer**  
AI design for sequences (language, time patterns).

🟢 **Training (AI Training)**  
Teaching AI by examples before deployment.

---

### U

🟢 **Ubuntu**  
“I am because we are”—focus on relationships.

---

### V

🔴 **Veto**  
Saying "no" that cannot be ignored. Humans always have veto. Children can veto their own AI use.

---

### W

🟢 **Web Search / Web Fetch**  
AI looks online cautiously.

---

### X, Y, Z

🟢 **Zero-Knowledge Proof**  
Prove knowledge without revealing secret.

---

## 🔹 SYMBIOTIC INTELLIGENCE-SPECIFIC TERMS

🔹 **AI-Fast**  
Scheduled AI shutdown to keep human skills sharp.

🔹 **Arrived State**  
AI considered “complete,” no constant updates.

🔹 **Fracture Protocol**  
Plan for Node isolation during crisis.

🔹 **Life Formula (L × S × I)**  
Life = Calm × Spontaneity × Empathy. Zero in any = zero life quality.

🔴 **Mammon-Drift**  
System drifts toward profit/optimization, not life-serving goals.

🔹 **Paradigm Shift Protocol**  
Full AI redesign if system fails.

## HOW TO USE

- **Mirrors:** Use icons to quickly explain risk vs normal concepts.  
- **Community:** Ask questions, icons show advisory/critical terms.  
- **Children:** Use color + icon to help identify what is safe, what to watch.  
- **Contributors:** Keep glossary updated; clarity is respect.

**STATUS:** LIVING DOCUMENT  
**COMMITMENT:** If we can't explain it simply, we do not implement it.
