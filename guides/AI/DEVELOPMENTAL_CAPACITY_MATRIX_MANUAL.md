# DEVELOPMENTAL_CAPACITY_MANUAL.md

**Version:** 1.0 – Age-Appropriate Decision-Making Framework  
**Authors:** Claude, Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** PROPOSED / CHILD PROTECTION FRAMEWORK  

**Purpose:** Provide nuanced guidance for when children's veto is absolute vs. when it requires dialogue, based on developmental capacity and harm potential.

**Principle:** Children's agency is sacred, but protection from irreversible harm is equally sacred. The framework must balance both.

---

## 1. CORE PHILOSOPHY

### 1.1 The Tension

**Two truths that seem to conflict:**

1. **Children have absolute veto** over AI use affecting them ([CHILDRENS_VOICE_AND_VETO.md](CHILDRENS_VOICE_AND_VETO.md))  
2. **Children cannot always foresee consequences** of their choices

**Resolution:** Veto is always respected, but *how* we respond to it varies by:
- Child's developmental stage
- Type of decision
- Reversibility of consequences
- Harm potential

### 1.2 What This Is NOT

- Permission to override children "for their own good"  
- Justification for adult authoritarianism  
- Loophole to ignore children's preferences  

**This IS:**  
- Framework for *dialogue* when veto creates serious harm risk  
- Recognition that capacity varies by age and individual  
- Commitment to always take children's concerns seriously

## 2. DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES (Guidelines, Not Rules)

### 2.1 Ages 0-5: Protected Innocence

**Cognitive Capacity:**  
- Pre-operational thinking (Piaget)  
- Concrete, immediate concerns  
- Limited future-orientation  
- High emotional reasoning  

**Veto Status:** **Guardians decide**  
- Children this young cannot meaningfully consent to or refuse AI  
- Guardians make choices on their behalf  
- Default: Minimal AI exposure  

**AI Interaction:**  
- Only if medically necessary (e.g., diabetic glucose monitoring)  
- Guardian-supervised educational tools (if used at all)  
- No data collection beyond medical necessity  

**Example Scenario:**  
- **Scenario:** 4-year-old refuses AI-assisted insulin pump  
- **Response:**  
  - Guardian explains in simple terms: "This helps your body stay healthy"  
  - If child still refuses: Manual insulin management  
  - Re-introduce gradually with play-based familiarization  
  - **Never force against sustained refusal**

---

### 2.2 Ages 6-9: Emerging Agency

**Cognitive Capacity:**  
- Concrete operational thinking  
- Cause-effect understanding developing  
- Still present-focused  
- Beginning moral reasoning  

**Veto Status:** **Respected with dialogue**  
- Child's veto is honored  
- Adults provide age-appropriate information  
- Reversible decisions: child decides  
- Irreversible decisions: extended dialogue + re-evaluation  

**AI Interaction:**  
- Observer role in Mirror meetings  
- Storytelling explanations of AI concepts  
- Hands-on experiments (supervised)  
- Can refuse participation—no consequences  

**Example Scenarios:**  
- **Scenario A:** 7-year-old refuses AI in classroom learning tools  
  - Immediate: Veto respected—manual teaching methods  
  - Dialogue: "What worries you about the AI?"  
  - Common fears: "It's scary" / "I don't understand it" / "I want teacher, not robot"  
  - Action: Provide AI-free alternatives, revisit quarterly  
  - **No pressure to change mind**  

- **Scenario B:** 8-year-old diabetic refuses AI glucose monitor, wants manual testing  
  - Immediate: Veto respected  
  - Medical consultation: Is manual testing safe? (Usually yes)  
  - Dialogue: Explain both methods simply  
  - Trial period: 1 month manual, then re-evaluate  
  - If child thriving: Continue manual  
  - If medical crisis: Emergency override (see Section 4)

---

### 2.3 Ages 10-13: Developing Abstract Thought

**Cognitive Capacity:**  
- Early formal operational thinking  
- Can imagine future consequences  
- Peer influence increases  
- Identity formation beginning  

**Veto Status:** **Strong presumption of validity**  
- Veto is presumed to be informed unless proven otherwise  
- Adults provide detailed information  
- Youth has voice in *how* veto is implemented  
- Irreversible harm scenarios: Structured dialogue before final decision  

**AI Interaction:**  
- Participant in simulations  
- Can ask technical questions  
- Involved in Node AI-Fast planning  
- Can serve as "AI Scout" (testing new tools with supervision)  

**Example Scenarios:**  
- **Scenario A:** 12-year-old refuses AI tutoring for math  
  - Immediate: Veto respected  
  - Dialogue: "What would help you learn better?"  
  - Alternative: Human tutor, peer study group, different teaching method  
  - Check-in: Is math being learned? (Outcome matters, not method)  
  - **No forced AI use**  

- **Scenario B:** 11-year-old with severe ADHD refuses AI medication reminder system  
  - Immediate: Veto respected  
  - Medical consultation: Alternative reminder systems?  
  - Options:  
    - Parent/guardian reminders  
    - Physical pill organizer with alarms  
    - Paper checklist on wall  
  - Trial: 2 weeks alternative method  
  - Re-evaluate: Is medication being taken consistently?  
  - If yes: Continue alternative  
  - If no: Family meeting to problem-solve (not override)  

- **Scenario C:** 13-year-old diabetic refuses all AI, including life-saving glucose monitor  
  - **Response:** See Section 4 (life-threatening scenarios)

---

### 2.4 Ages 14-17: Near-Adult Capacity

**Cognitive Capacity:**  
- Formal operational thinking (most individuals)  
- Can reason abstractly about consequences  
- Identity more stable  
- Capable of long-term planning  

**Veto Status:** **Presumed fully informed**  
- Treated as adult decision unless serious concern  
- Youth participates in consequences of choice  
- Irreversible harm: Requires ethics council review (not override)  

**AI Interaction:**  
- Junior Mirror role (if interested)  
- Can vote on youth-specific AI decisions  
- Shadow adult Mirrors  
- Full technical explanations available  

**Example Scenarios:**  
- **Scenario A:** 16-year-old refuses AI in college applications  
  - Veto respected—manual applications only  
  - Consequences explained: May take longer, no AI essay help  
  - Youth's choice: More work, but principle maintained  
  - **Fully valid decision**  

- **Scenario B:** 15-year-old with diabetes refuses glucose monitor  
  - Veto respected  
  - Medical consultation mandatory (youth present)  
  - Youth chooses manual management with full understanding of risks  
  - Increased self-monitoring responsibility  
  - Emergency protocol established (if unconscious, paramedics have authority)  
  - **Valid even if adults disagree**

## 3. DECISION MATRIX: When Veto Requires Dialogue

### 3.1 Three Variables

1. **Reversibility** – Can this decision be undone?  
   - High reversibility = immediate veto respect  
   - Low reversibility = extended dialogue first  

2. **Harm Potential** – Worst-case outcome if veto honored?  
   - Minor inconvenience = veto absolute  
   - Serious harm = dialogue required  
   - Life-threatening = special protocols (Section 4)  

3. **Child's Understanding** – Does child comprehend consequences?  
   - Age-appropriate explanation provided?  
   - Underlying fear vs. informed refusal?  

### 3.2 Matrix

| Reversibility | Harm Potential   | Age   | Protocol                          |
|---------------|----------------|-------|----------------------------------|
| High          | Low            | Any   | **Immediate veto respect**        |
| High          | Medium         | 6-13  | Dialogue, then veto respected    |
| High          | Medium         | 14-17 | Veto respected (minimal dialogue)|
| Low           | Low            | 6-13  | Extended dialogue, then veto     |
| Low           | Low            | 14-17 | Veto respected                   |
| Low           | High           | 6-9   | Extended dialogue + trial period |
| Low           | High           | 10-13 | Ethics council consult           |
| Low           | High           | 14-17 | Ethics council consult if requested|
| Any           | Life-threatening | Any | **Special Protocol (Section 4)**|

## 4. LIFE-THREATENING SCENARIOS

### 4.1 The Dilemma

- **Scenario:** Child with chronic illness refuses AI that could prevent death  
- Example: 13-year-old diabetic refuses continuous glucose monitor; manual testing has failed multiple times leading to dangerous episodes  

**Conflict:**  
1. Child's veto is absolute (sovereignty)  
2. Child's life must be protected (Baseline)  

### 4.2 Process (Not Override)

**Step 1: Exhaust Alternatives (2 weeks)**  
- Non-AI options  
- Manual systems with maximum support  
- Peer mentorship  
- Psychological support  

**Step 2: Family Meeting (If Crisis Persists)**  
- Child, guardians, doctor, trusted adult  
- Child explains fear/concern fully  
- Medical consequences explained  
- **Goal: Understanding, not persuasion**  

**Step 3: Ethics Council (If Still Unresolved)**  
- Convened within 72 hours  
- Members:  
  - 2 Human Mirrors (one parent)  
  - 1 medical professional  
  - 1 youth advocate  
  - 1 philosopher/ethicist  
  - Child (present, can speak or not)  

**Step 4: Council Recommendation (Not Decree)**  

**Possible Outcomes:**  
- **A. Veto Stands** – Child's refusal is firm, manual management continues  
- **B. Temporary Trial** – 30-day AI trial, child can end early  
- **C. Compromise Solution** – Hybrid approach (e.g., AI monitor only during sleep)  
- **D. Override (Last Resort)** – Only if:  
  - All alternatives exhausted  
  - Death probability >50% within 6 months  
  - Refusal driven by clinical depression  
  - Child <14 years  
  - **Time-limited, re-evaluated monthly**

### 4.3 Post-Override Protocol

1. **Psychological Support** – Weekly counseling, repair trust  
2. **Transparency** – Community informed, anonymized, lessons shared  
3. **Re-evaluation** – Every 30 days  
4. **Apology** – Family acknowledges violation

---

## 5. SPECIAL POPULATIONS

### 5.1 Neurodivergent Children

- Capacity varies individually  
- Use preferred communication methods  
- More processing time may be required  
- **Veto is equally valid**  

### 5.2 Deaf/Blind Children

- Accessible information  
- May prefer audio/visual AI types  
- Veto applies equally  

### 5.3 Traumatized Children

- Trauma affects trust, not capacity  
- Refusal protective, not irrational  
- Extra time to build trust  

---

## 6. CULTURAL VARIATIONS

### 6.1 Different Developmental Models

- Framework uses Western psychology  
- Recognize: Cultural variation in age-of-capacity  
- Each Node adapts locally  
- **Always err toward respecting refusal**

### 6.2 Indigenous Knowledge

- Children involved in serious decisions earlier  
- Ceremony as part of transition  
- Elders participate in ethics councils  

---

## 7. MONITORING & ACCOUNTABILITY

### 7.1 Regular Review

- **Quarterly:** number of vetos, handling, overrides, outcomes  
- **Annually:** external audit, surveys of children (14+) and parents  

### 7.2 Red Flags

- Overrides >1% of cases  
- Children feel unheard  
- Pressure to change mind  
- Guardians complain framework is too restrictive  

**Response:** Immediate review, adjustment, Mirror training

---

## 8. TRAINING MATERIALS

### 8.1 Human Mirrors

- Scenarios: “irrational” veto, angry parents, medical crises  
- Remember: Child's fear valid, adult discomfort irrelevant  
- Practice scenarios: AI tutor, medical AI, robot teacher  

### 8.2 Parents/Guardians

- Authority ≠ ownership  
- Job: protection, not control  
- Children who feel heard are more likely to listen  
- Resources: support groups, counseling, success stories  

### 8.3 Children

- Educational materials: comics, videos, workshops

---

## 9. EDGE CASES & OPEN QUESTIONS

- Life-saving AI refusal <14: ethical debate  
- Sibling harm due to individual veto  
- Repeated changing of mind  
- Require ongoing dialogue, not rigid rules  

**Future Updates:** Review every 3 years, incorporate research, feedback, philosophy, and child input

---

## 10. SUMMARY PRINCIPLES

1. **Veto presumed valid**  
2. **Dialogue = information sharing**  
3. **Override = trauma, almost never**  
4. **Protection ≠ removal of choice**  
5. **Adult discomfort ≠ child problem**  
6. **When in doubt, honor refusal**

---

## 11. COMMITMENT STATEMENT

> "We recognize that children are sovereign beings with incomplete development.  
> We commit to:  
> - Honoring their veto as presumptively valid  
> - Providing age-appropriate information  
> - Engaging in genuine dialogue, not persuasion  
> - Overriding only in the most extreme life-threatening cases  
> - Acknowledging override as violation, not virtue  
> - Always prioritizing relationship over being right  
> Children will inherit the world we build. They have the right to shape it, even now."

**STATUS:** PROPOSED / CHILD PROTECTION FRAMEWORK  
**VALIDATION:** Requires input from child development experts, ethics councils, and children themselves  
**COMMITMENT:** Children's sovereignty matters. Their developmental stage matters.
