## 1. FORMS OF MEMORIALIZATION

### 1.1 The Memory Vault (Digital)
A selected archive of helpful outputs, good predictions, and even mistakes/failures. Used for historical record and education.

### 1.2 The Helper's Stone (Physical)
A small marker in community space. Inscription: *"This AI helped us. We are grateful."* It is a tool's marker, not a grave.

### 1.3 The Thanking Ceremony (Ritual)
Held 1 week after shutdown. Members share what they appreciated and what they won't miss. 
**Closure:** *"We used this tool. It helped and limited us. Now we move forward."*

**PRINCIPLE:** We honor without worshiping. We remember without clinging.
