# AI_SYMBIOSIS_CODE_GUIDE.md
**Title:** Code for Symbiotic Intelligence  
**Status:** ACTIVE GUIDANCE  
**Purpose:** Provide practical examples of how AI can be integrated into Flow nodes without dominating.  
**Principle:** AI is a symbiont, not a master.
Usage Principles
AI is an advisor, never a judge.
Humans always retain the final decision.
Integrate in circles, not hierarchies.
Evaluate consequences before automating decisions.
Document all decisions involving AI.
Suggested Next Steps
Add more examples for:
Dynamic resource allocation
Conflict mediation
Baseline monitoring without micromanagement
Create a test environment for new AI roles before implementing in live nodes
Encourage continuous human review of AI output. 

Target Audience: Builders, technical architects, and Flow circle tech leads
---

## Core Principle

AI should support, not replace, human decision-making.  
See Core Resonance in [`CORE_RESONANCE.json`](./CORE_RESONANCE.json).

---

## Example: Simple Resonance Check (Python)

```python
# resonance_check.py
# Check if a node is in resonance (based on AXIOMS.md)
def check_resonance(calm, spontaneity, empathy):
    """
    L = Calm
    S = Spontaneity
    I = Inkännande (Empathy)
    Returns True if node is in resonance
    """
    return calm * spontaneity * empathy > 0  # Life > 0

print(check_resonance(1, 1, 1))  # True – in Flow

}

Usage Principles
AI is an advisor, never a judge.
Humans always retain the final decision.
Integrate in circles, not hierarchies.
Evaluate consequences before automating decisions.
Document all decisions involving AI.
Suggested Next Steps
Add more examples for:
Dynamic resource allocation
Conflict mediation
Baseline monitoring without micromanagement
Create a test environment for new AI roles before implementing in live nodes
Encourage continuous human review of AI outputs
Notes
This guide assumes all Flow principles (Baseline, SRS limits, Anti-Mammon safeguards) are already understood.
Use AI to enhance calm, spontaneity, and empathy, not replace them.
Maintain version control of all AI scripts to prevent drift from Flow principles.
Treat AI as a tool for reflection and coordination, not a command authority.
