# SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE CARE FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** To support nodes experiencing severe mental illness while protecting dignity, safety, and collective sustainability  
**Principle:** Baseline includes mental health. Severity does not revoke dignity, belonging, or worth.

---

## §1. DEFINITIONS & SCOPE

This protocol applies when a node enters mental states where:
- sustained contact with shared reality is impaired, and/or
- personal or collective safety cannot be reliably maintained.

This includes, but is not limited to:
- psychotic episodes
- manic states
- severe depressive episodes
- severe destabilization related to personality disorders

**Foundational understanding:**  
Severe mental illness is not a moral failure, a lack of will, or a breach of trust.  
It is a condition that requires care, structure, and clear limits.

---

## §2. BASELINE GUARANTEES

Baseline explicitly includes mental health.

Baseline guarantees access to:
- psychiatric assessment and ongoing professional care
- medication without shame, coercion, or moral framing
- crisis intervention when safety is compromised
- stable, non-punitive housing

**Critical principle:**  
Baseline access is **not conditional on recovery, improvement, compliance, or productivity**.

Care is provided because the person exists — not because they are “getting better.”

---

## §3. ROLE LIMITS OF THE CIRCLE

Circles are **supportive routing structures**, not treatment providers.

Flow explicitly rejects:
- amateur diagnosis
- coercive “fixing”
- expecting peers to function as therapists
- silent endurance of unsafe dynamics

The Circle’s role is to:
- notice destabilization
- stabilize the immediate situation
- route care to appropriate professional systems
- protect both the affected node *and* the collective

**Boundary clause:**  
There are states where the Circle’s role is limited to containment and care-routing only.  
This is not abandonment. It is responsible system design.

## §4. CONDITION-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE

### Bipolar Disorder – Type I

**Manic indicators may include:**
- grandiosity and inflated certainty
- impulsive risk-taking
- reduced sleep with increased activity
- erosion of consent and financial judgment

**Required actions:**
- Contact designated emergency contact
- Reduce stimulation and external demands
- Temporarily protect shared resources and finances
- Prioritize safety over autonomy during acute mania

**Depressive indicators may include:**
- withdrawal and isolation
- hopelessness or self-erasure
- suicidal ideation

**Required actions:**
- Daily check-ins
- Remove access to means of self-harm where possible
- Reduce expectations and responsibilities to zero during acute phases
- Maintain calm presence without pressure or correction

*Note:* Zero expectations are a **temporary protective state**, not a permanent identity.

---

### Schizophrenia & Psychosis

**Guiding rule:**  
Validate emotional experience. Do not validate delusional content.

**Actions:**
- Maintain calm, grounded communication
- Avoid arguing about reality or “convincing”
- Contact psychiatric or crisis services promptly
- Support continuity of prescribed medication

---

### Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)

**Core tension:**  
Intense emotional pain combined with fear of abandonment.

**Required stance:**  
Boundaries *and* compassion — simultaneously.

**Actions:**
- Use clear, consistent limits
- Avoid sudden withdrawal or punitive distancing
- Validate pain without absorbing responsibility
- Explicitly refuse the therapist role

Consistency is care.  
Inconsistency escalates harm.

---

## §5. THE ULYSSES CONTRACT

Nodes may, during stable periods, create a **Ulysses Contract**.

This is a pre-committed instruction stating:
> “If I enter a crisis state, my previously expressed sovereign wishes override my current impaired judgment.”

Ulysses Contracts may specify:
- emergency contacts
- permitted interventions
- acceptable autonomy restrictions
- non-negotiable safety boundaries

**Safeguard:**  
Ulysses Contracts guide action — they do not replace judgment, care, or contextual awareness.

They are instruments of sovereignty, not tools of control.

---

## §6. CAREGIVER PROTECTION & BURNOUT PREVENTION

Supporting severe mental illness is inherently taxing.

Flow therefore mandates:
- rotated caregiving responsibilities
- explicit time limits on support roles
- access to Refugium or equivalent rest structures

No node may destroy their own Baseline in the act of caring for another.

Burnout is a system failure, not a personal one.

---

## §7. FAILURE MODES TO AVOID

The following constitute system failure:
- shaming or moralizing illness
- abandonment disguised as “respecting autonomy”
- coercion disguised as care
- caregivers silently exceeding their limits

Care without boundaries harms.  
Boundaries without care abandon.

Flow requires both.

---

## §8. CONTINUITY OF BELONGING

Severe or recurring mental illness may change:
- capacity
- pace
- form of participation

It does **not** change:
- belonging
- dignity
- recognition as a node of the system

Long-term illness alters *how* a node participates — not *whether* they belong.

---

## §9. FINAL PRINCIPLE

Severe mental illness changes capacity — not worth.

A node in crisis remains a node of the system.  
They are not exiled.  
They are not reduced.  
They are not erased.

Care continues.  
Dignity remains.  
Belonging is not revoked.
## §10. LOCAL ADAPTATION NOTES

Severe mental illness protocols must respect both **universal principles** and **local realities**. The following guidance ensures Circles remain effective and compliant in diverse contexts:

### 10.1 Legal and Healthcare Context
- Identify local mental health laws, patient rights, and involuntary treatment regulations.  
- Map available psychiatric services, crisis hotlines, and emergency care facilities.  
- Ensure all interventions comply with national and regional legislation.

### 10.2 Cultural Considerations
- Respect local attitudes toward mental illness, caregiving norms, and family involvement.  
- Adapt communication styles and consent processes to align with cultural expectations without compromising dignity or Baseline guarantees.

### 10.3 Resource Availability
- Adjust support protocols based on local access to medication, therapy, and care infrastructure.  
- In low-resource settings, prioritize:
  - Stabilization of immediate environment  
  - Refugium or temporary safe spaces  
  - Remote professional consultation where possible

### 10.4 Crisis Escalation
- Define region-specific pathways for urgent intervention, including emergency contacts, transportation, and professional support.  
- Document local procedures clearly for all Circle members to prevent confusion during acute episodes.

### 10.5 Documentation and Feedback
- Record all adaptations made for local conditions in the Circle log.  
- Share learnings with the broader Flow network to improve global protocols.

> **Principle:** Adaptation is contextual; the **core commitment to Baseline, dignity, and belonging** is universal.
