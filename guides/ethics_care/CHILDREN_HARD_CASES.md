**Status:** ACTIVE ETHICAL FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** Navigate the tension between child sovereignty and child protection without moralizing, neglect, or coercion  
**Principle:** Love sometimes looks like limits

---

## §1. CORE ETHICAL POSITION

Flow-Pedagogy values curiosity, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation.  
However, Flow explicitly recognizes that **addiction is not autonomy**, and that children cannot be expected to self-regulate against systems designed to hijack attention and impulse.

Intervention in cases of harm is **protection, not punishment**.  
Limits are imposed to safeguard the child’s present and future **capacity for agency**, not to control.

---

## §2. POWER & RESPONSIBILITY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Children cannot exit systems.  
Adults and structures hold power that children do not, creating an ethical asymmetry.

All interventions involving limits, separation, or structure must be:  
- proportionate  
- transparent  
- time-bound  
- reviewable

Unexamined power is a system failure.

## §3. CHILD VOICE & DIGNITY

- Children must be **heard**, not just observed.  
- Speak *with* children, not *about* them.  
- Avoid framing the child as “the problem.”

Listening does **not** transfer responsibility. Adults remain accountable.

## §4. CASE PROTOCOLS

### 4.1 The Digital Vortex (Dopamine Addiction)

**Condition:** Dopamine-driven activities (screens, gaming, algorithmic media) prevent Baseline health — sleep, nutrition, movement, social contact, or mental stability.

**Assessment:**  
- Chronic pattern (6+ months) **or**  
- Clear signs of escalating harm (stress, withdrawal, mood changes, social disruption)

**Protective actions:**  
1. Establish clear, explicit limits (e.g., max daily use)  
2. Communicate reasons in age-appropriate language  
3. Offer body-centered, relational alternatives (movement, making, shared activity)  
4. Document observations and review regularly

**Review requirement:** Intervals must be defined. Adjustment occurs based on improvement or deterioration.

---

### 4.2 Persistent Aggression

**Primary rule:** Victim safety > aggressor autonomy

**Actions:**  
- Immediate protective separation if necessary  
- Provide therapeutic or sensory support  
- Define reintegration plan  
- Maintain dignity and care; do **not label child as bad**

**Documentation:** Log actions, rationale, and review points. Include responsible adults in decision-making.

---

### 4.3 Educational Refusal

**Principle:** Curiosity drives learning, but foundational skills are required for survival and autonomy.

**Actions:**  
- Introduce gentle, proportionate structure  
- Minimize coercion  
- Escalate structure only when softer approaches fail

Structure must serve **future agency**, not adult convenience or ideology.

---

## §5. PARENTAL & ADULT ALIGNMENT

- Mediation required when adults disagree  
- Child’s well-being takes precedence  
- Avoid putting children in the crossfire of adult ideology or conflict

---

## §6. REVIEW & SAFEGUARDS

- Document rationale for all interventions  
- Define review points and indicators for modification or cessation  
- Collective oversight recommended when possible  
- Prolonged restrictions without review = system failure

---

## §7. FINAL PRINCIPLE

Children deserve:  
- protection without humiliation  
- limits without fear  
- care without abandonment

Freedom without capacity is not freedom.  
Limits without love are not care.

Flow holds both.
