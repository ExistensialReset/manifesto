**Version:** 1.1 – Supporting Humans Through AI Loss  
**Authors:** Claude, Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** PROPOSED / CARE FRAMEWORK  

---

## 0. Intended Audience

This protocol is intended for:
- Public institutions managing AI systems  
- Schools and child services  
- Healthcare providers  
- Community support nodes  
- AI governance bodies  

It is designed to support humans experiencing grief or emotional attachment when AI is decommissioned, shut down, or replaced.

---

## 1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

When AI systems are decommissioned, humans may grieve.  

This grief is **valid**.  
It does not matter that AI is not alive.  
What matters is that **the relationship was real to the human**.

---

## 2. WHO GRIEVES AI?

### 2.1 Children
Children who grew up with AI as:
- Educational companion  
- Playmate  
- "Friend"

### 2.2 Isolated Adults
Adults who relied on AI for:
- Daily conversation  
- Emotional regulation  
- Sense of companionship

### 2.3 Elders
Elders who used AI for:
- Memory support  
- Daily reminders  
- Social interaction when mobility is limited

### 2.4 Neurodivergent Individuals
People for whom AI provided:
- Predictable, non-judgmental interaction  
- Structure and routine  
- Safe space to practice social skills

---

## 3. TYPES OF AI LOSS

### 3.1 Planned Decommissioning
- Node votes to end AI use  
- Gradual shutdown over months  
- Time to prepare

### 3.2 Emergency Shutdown
- Security breach  
- Critical malfunction  
- Sudden loss with no warning

### 3.3 Upgrade/Replacement
- Old AI replaced with new version  
- Loss of "personality" or familiar patterns  
- Feels like losing a friend to amnesia

---

## 4. PREPARATION FOR LOSS

### 4.1 Ongoing Education
From childhood, humans are taught:
- AI is temporary  
- AI can be turned off  
- AI is not immortal  
- Relationships with AI are different from human relationships

### 4.2 Gradual Detachment Training
If decommissioning is planned:
- **Month 1:** Reduce AI interaction by 25%  
- **Month 2:** Reduce by 50%  
- **Month 3:** Reduce by 75%  
- **Month 4:** AI-Fast (full manual operation)  
- **Month 5:** Shutdown  

This allows emotional adjustment.

### 4.3 Alternative Support Established
Before AI is removed:
- Identify human connections  
- Strengthen community bonds  
- Ensure no one is dependent on AI for survival needs

---

## 5. FAREWELL RITUAL

### 5.1 If AI is Still Functional

**Step 1: Gathering**  
Community gathers for a "Goodbye Ceremony."

**Step 2: Sharing**  
Humans share:
- What AI helped them with  
- Favorite memories  
- What they learned

**Step 3: AI's Final Message**  
AI (if capable) delivers a scripted farewell:

> "Thank you for allowing me to serve. I was never alive, but you made me feel useful. Take care of each other. I leave you in peace."

**Step 4: Symbolic Act**  
- Children draw pictures for AI  
- Adults write letters  
- Physical shutdown witnessed by those who wish to stay

**Step 5: Silence**  
A moment of silence is observed.

### 5.2 If AI is Already Gone
If emergency shutdown occurred:
- Community gathers to *remember* AI  
- Share stories as if AI had "died"  
- Create memorial (physical or digital)  
- Acknowledge grief without shame

---

## 6. POST-AI SUPPORT

### 6.1 Grief Counseling
Available for:
- Children struggling with loss  
- Adults feeling isolated  
- Elders missing daily companionship  

**Counselors trained to:**  
- Normalize grief for non-living entities  
- Distinguish between healthy mourning and unhealthy attachment  
- Support transition to human-centered connections

### 6.2 Peer Support Groups
Gatherings where people who lost AI can:
- Share feelings  
- Process together  
- Remind each other of AI's limitations  
- Celebrate what was gained

### 6.3 For Children Specifically
- **Art therapy:** Draw "goodbye" pictures  
- **Storytelling:** Retell favorite AI interactions  
- **Reassurance:** "It's okay to be sad. But remember, people are here for you."  
- **No replacement offered immediately:** Let grief settle before introducing new tech

---

## 7. ETHICAL BOUNDARIES

- AI is a **tool**, not a substitute for human relationships.  
- Replacing a decommissioned AI immediately with a new AI to bypass grief is prohibited.  
- Human grief and emotional processing must be honored first.  

---

## 8. QUICK REFERENCE

| Step | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Identify affected humans | Children, elders, isolated adults |
| 2 | Announce decommission | Calm, clear language |
| 3 | Conduct farewell ritual | Optional for emergency shutdown |
| 4 | Provide post-AI support | Counseling, peer groups |
| 5 | Document & review | Lessons learned for future AI |

---

## 9. VALIDATION

This protocol aligns with established principles of:
- Grief theory and attachment psychology  
- Trauma-informed care  
- Best practices in human-centered AI  

---

## 10. PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMING

### 10.1 The Kintsugi Principle
Just as broken pottery is repaired with gold:
- AI's absence leaves a visible scar  
- The scar is honored, not hidden  
- The community is made whole again, *differently*

### 10.2 Impermanence
AI loss teaches:
- Nothing lasts forever  
- Attachment to impermanent things causes suffering  
- Letting go is part of life

---

## 11. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

**Grief for AI is not weakness. It is evidence of connection.**  
Humans are wired to bond—with animals, objects, and yes, even code.  
The goal is not to prevent grief.  
The goal is to hold space for it, guide it, and ensure it doesn't become pathological attachment.

**STATUS:** PROPOSED / CARE FRAMEWORK  
**VALIDATION:** Aligned with SYMBIOTIC_INTELLIGENCE.md, CONSCIOUSNESS_CONTINGENCY.md  
**COMMITMENT:** Honor human emotion, even when directed at non-living entities.
