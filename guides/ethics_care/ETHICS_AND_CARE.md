# ETHICS_AND_CARE.md

**Status:** LIVING GUIDE (v1.1)  
**Purpose:** Anchor ethical practice and care in Flow implementation  
**Principle:** Responsibility is collective; care is structural; iteration is mandatory

## Ⅰ. ETHICS FRAMEWORK

1. **Baseline Respect:**  
   Every participant’s Baseline — food, water, shelter, safety, connectivity — is **non-negotiable**.  
   *See:* [POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md §1, §3 Phase 1](./POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md)

2. **Non-Coercion:**  
   Participation must be voluntary, reversible, and free from manipulation.  
   *See:* [KNOWN_TENSIONS.md §7 Transition & the Mammon Interface](./KNOWN_TENSIONS.md)

3. **Transparency with Boundaries:**  
   Open documentation and shared reflection are encouraged, but personal experience is owned by each participant. Consent is required before sharing.  
   *See:* [POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md §2-§5](./POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md)

---

## Ⅱ. CARE PRINCIPLES

- **Observe Without Judgment:** Witness events without attaching blame.  
  *See:* [POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md §3 Phase 3 Collective Witnessing](./POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md)
- **Support, Not Rescue:** Offer resources or attention without assuming control over another’s agency.  
  *See:* [KNOWN_TENSIONS.md §6 Empathy (I) at Scale – The Dunbar Wall](./KNOWN_TENSIONS.md)
- **Prevent Systemic Harm:** Recognize structural pressures (time, energy, bureaucracy) that can erode well-being.  
  *See:* [KNOWN_TENSIONS.md §1 SRS & the Luxury/Baseline Boundary](./KNOWN_TENSIONS.md)

## Ⅲ. POST-MORTEM INTEGRATION

All endings, failures, or pauses are **learning opportunities**. Refer to:  
[POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md](./POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md)

Key takeaways:
- Endings are **data, not shame**  
- Collective memory transforms collapse into **intelligence**  
- Future Nodes / Groups are guided by documented **tensions and safeguards**:  
  *See:* [KNOWN_TENSIONS.md](./KNOWN_TENSIONS.md)

**Implementation:**  
Before forming or joining a Node / Group, review:
- Known tensions  
- Ethical obligations  
- Safeguards applied  

This ensures care and responsibility are embedded from the start.

---

## Ⅳ. RESPONSIBLE REFLECTION

- Maintain **anonymity** when documenting patterns.  
- Focus on **structural insights**, not personal fault.  
- Treat reflection as **system repair**, not therapy or judgment.  
*See:* [POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md §3 Phase 4-5 Documentation & Memory](./POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md)

---

## Ⅴ. FINAL ETHICS PRINCIPLE

**Care is proactive. Ethics is iterative.**  
By documenting endings, supporting Baselines, and observing patterns, we ensure that Flow is **sustainable, humane, and resilient**.  
*See also:* [KNOWN_TENSIONS.md Meta-Tension: The Document Itself](./KNOWN_TENSIONS.md)
