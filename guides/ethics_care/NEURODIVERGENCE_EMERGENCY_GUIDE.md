# 🚨 NEURODIVERGENCE_EMERGENCY_GUIDE.md

**Status:** EMERGENCY PROTOCOL (Global Edition)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Immediate intervention for neurodivergent nodes in crisis, applicable in any environment.  
**Principle:** Regulate the biology first. Sovereignty is maintained through the body.

---

## Ⅰ. ACUTE OVERWHELM (Meltdown / Shutdown)
*When the world is too loud, too fast, or too much.*

**For the Node in Crisis:**
1. **Visual Shield:** Close your eyes or cover them with your hands or a cloth. If you cannot change the room, change your internal view.
2. **The 5-4-3-2-1 Somatic Reset:**
   - Touch 5 different textures (soil, fabric, skin, stone, wood).
   - Listen for 4 distinct sounds (even if they are far away).
   - Smell 3 things (even the air).
   - Notice 2 internal sensations (heartbeat, breath).
   - Identify 1 thing that is beautiful or stable.
3. **Internal Silence:** Give yourself permission to stop translating your world into words. You do not owe anyone an explanation for your state.

**For the Circle / Supporters:**
- **CREATE DISTANCE:** In high-stress or crowded environments, form a physical "buffer" around the person. Keep others at a distance.
- **NO-TOUCH DEFAULT:** Never touch an overwhelmed person without clear verbal consent.
- **TONE OVER CONTENT:** Do not ask "Why?" Speak in a low, rhythmic monotone: *"I am here. We are waiting. The earth is steady."*
- **TIME IS THE MEDICINE:** Do not rush the recovery. The biology needs its own time to return to L (Calm).

## Ⅱ. THE BURNED-OUT NODE (Total Exhaustion)
*When energy is depleted and survival feels like a task.*

1. **The Ground Protocol:** Lie flat on the ground. Let the earth take the weight of your body. This is the most basic form of Baseline connection.
2. **Hydration First:** Water is the most immediate regulator. Sip it slowly.
3. **Strategic Invisibility:** If you are in a high-pressure social environment, find a corner or a spot under a tree. You are allowed to "disappear" from the social field to protect your internal Node.
4. **Communal Triage:** If you cannot cook or clean, the Circle provides. This is what the Baseline guarantee is for. No shame.

## Ⅲ. SPIRALS OF SHAME & FEAR (RSD / Anxiety)
*When the brain says "you are failing" or "they hate you."*

1. **Wait for the Pulse:** Your brain is sending an "emergency signal" that isn't true. Wait for 24 hours (one sleep cycle) before believing the fear or taking drastic action.
2. **The Anchor Person:** Identify one person who doesn't judge. Say: *"I am in a shame-loop."* They don't need to fix it; they just need to witness that you are still here.
3. **The Simple Act:** Do one physical, repetitive task (braiding hair, sorting stones, washing one cloth). Rhythm is the enemy of anxiety.

## Ⅳ. SUICIDE & EXISTENTIAL COLLAPSE
*When life feels like a burden you cannot carry.*

1. **Physiological Triage:** Are you hungry? Are you cold? Are you in pain? Most "death-wishes" are actually "rest-wishes" or "escape-wishes" from unbearable physical/sensory load.
2. **The Shared Breath:** If you can, sit with another node. No talking. Just breathe in the same rhythm. This is co-regulation—the nervous system's oldest medicine.
3. **The "Not Now" Vow:** Tell yourself: *"I will stay until the sun rises/sets."* Repeat as needed.

## Ⅴ. QUICK SCAN: UNIVERSAL SIGNALS

| Signal | Biological State | Immediate Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Silent / Frozen** | Shutdown (Dorsal Vagal) | Warmth, slow breath, no pressure. |
| **Screaming / Agitated** | Meltdown (Sympathetic) | Space, reduced noise, "buffer" zone. |
| **Panic / Pacing** | Anxiety (Flight) | Repetitive rhythm, grounding (feet on earth). |
| **Numb / Empty** | Burnout (Depletion) | Full rest, Baseline food/water, zero tasks. |

**STATUS:** OPERATIONAL.  
**REMEMBER:** You are a living node of a global network. Your vibration matters, even when it is low. You are allowed to be broken. You are allowed to rest.

*“Rest is not a luxury. It is a logistical requirement for sovereignty.”*
