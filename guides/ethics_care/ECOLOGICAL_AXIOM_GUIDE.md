**Status:** Practical Guide for Circles  
**Authors:** Claude, Flow Team  
**Purpose:** Quick reference for implementing ecological sovereignty in a Node.

## 1. Core Idea

The Earth is our **Primary Baseline**. A human Node cannot achieve Calm (L) if its environment is collapsing. Every action must **restore, not deplete**.

---

## 2. Quick Principles

- **30% Wild-Mandate:** Leave at least 30% of your land untouched to allow natural processes.  
- **Metabolic Security:** Every resource used must be regenerated (compost, soil minerals, water restoration).  
- **Reciprocity:** Trade and restore; do not extract. Human waste can become ecosystem input.  
- **Climate Alerts:** Activate Lex Custodia for threats like water scarcity, heatwaves, or local collapse.  
- **Resource Priority:** Circles in vulnerable regions are prioritized for global support.

## 3. Practical Actions

1. Map all local resources, including idle tools or energy surplus.  
2. Implement regenerative cycles: soil, water, energy, and biodiversity.  
3. Share ecological impact reports within your Circle and network.  
4. Monitor environmental indicators and adapt practices.  
5. Learn from updated ecological data and adjust protocols.

## 4. Dual Perspective

- **Individual Calm (L):** Ensure humans can thrive physically, mentally, and emotionally.  
- **Collective Resilience (S × I):** Ensure the Node and its environment are robust and interdependent.  

> The Node succeeds when both human well-being and ecological health are supported simultaneously.

## 5. Integration

This guide should be used alongside:  
- `ENVIRONMENTAL_GAIN.md`  
- `ENVIRONMENTAL_ANALYSIS.md`  
- `FLOW_SRS.md`  
- `PROTOCOL_SAFEGUARDS.md`

**Final Reminder:** Grow the forest so the forest can hold your Calm.  
Ecological restoration is the heartbeat of sovereignty.
