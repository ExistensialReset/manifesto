**Guiding lens:** L × S × I  
- **Lugn:** Awareness of one’s own state and its consequences  
- **Spontanitet:** Flexible, context-sensitive responses  
- **Inkännande:** Empathy for self and others affected

**Checklist:**  
  - Peer or Circle awareness of use  
  - Safe environment (hydration, seating, ventilation)  
  - Emergency contact known  
  - Post-use reflection encouraged  

### 1.2 Regular but Non-Harmful Use
- Ongoing use without evident harm to self or others.  
**Checklist:**  
  - Weekly self-check-ins  
  - Peer monitoring for escalation signs  
  - Access to harm reduction materials

**Checklist:**  
  - Escalated monitoring (daily check-ins)  
  - Temporary adjustment of responsibilities  
  - Harm reduction measures in place  
  - Offer voluntary therapy or professional guidance  
  - Document anonymized events  

### 1.4 Secondary Harm
- Effects on children, vulnerable people, or shared resources.  
**Checklist:**  
  - Immediate protection of affected parties  
  - Temporary separation from sensitive roles or spaces  
  - Careful communication to reduce shame  
  - Integration with `SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL.md` if relevant

## §2. COMMUNITY PROTECTIONS

- **Children and vulnerable individuals** always have Baseline prioritized.  
- **Shared spaces** may have substance-free zones; participation requires informed consent.  
- **Transparency** about state is encouraged, not enforced.  
- **Consequences** (e.g., temporarily restricted access to sensitive roles) are **ethical, not punitive**.  

> ⚠️ Principle: Baseline is sacred. Interventions protect the system, not punish the individual.

## §3. SUPPORT & HARM REDUCTION

- **Medical integration:** Coordinate with prescribed medications (e.g., for bipolar disorder).  
- **Crisis readiness:** Immediate support if substance use threatens Baseline safety.  
- **Resource access:** Peer or professional guidance, safe supply information, and education on interactions.  
- **Non-coercive intervention:** Support without requiring abstinence unless chosen by the individual.  

---

## §4. DOCUMENTATION & LEARNING

- Events that compromise Baseline or safety should be **anonymously logged** for learning, pattern recognition, and system improvement.  
- Logs are **confidential**, not punitive.  
- Post-mortem reflection is encouraged for communal understanding.  

**Integration:** Link observations to:  
- `SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL.md`  
- `SHARED_RESOURCE_CONFLICT.md`  
- `BASELINE.md` or equivalent local Baseline definitions

## §5. DECISION-MAKING FLOW

1. **Observe** → note signs of risk or harm.  
2. **Assess** → check L × S × I readiness of the Circle to intervene.  
3. **Support** → implement care, harm reduction, or temporary adjustments.  
4. **Document** → anonymize and log incidents.  
5. **Reflect** → use for learning, adaptation, and preventive measures.

> All interventions are reversible, time-limited, and consensual where possible.

## §6. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

> Substance use is **part of human reality**, not a moral failing.  
> Flow protects Baseline, values autonomy, and prioritizes care, empathy, and learning.  
> Intervention is **protective**, never punitive.  
> Documentation is **for learning**, not shame.
