# 🌈 NEURODIVERGENT FLOW GUIDE: Building Circles That Actually Work for Our Brains

**Status:** ACCESSIBILITY PROTOCOL  
**For:** Autistic, ADHD, traumatized, and otherwise neurodivergent humans  
**Core Principle:** The Circle adapts to you. You don't adapt to the Circle.

---

## PREAMBLE: YOU BELONG HERE

**Flow is for everyone.**

**But.**

Most "community building" guides are written for neurotypical brains.

They assume:
- You can socialize for hours without exhaustion
- You process emotions in real-time
- You can handle unpredictability
- You communicate verbally when stressed
- You don't need sensory accommodations

**If that's not you:**

**This guide is for you.**

## PART I: ADAPTATIONS FOR AUTISTIC FOLKS

### What Autistic Brains Often Need:

**1. Predictability**

**What helps:**
- Fixed meeting times (same day, same time every week)
- Shared agenda sent 24 hours ahead
- Clear start/end times (and stick to them)
- Explicit social rules (written down)

**Example agenda:**

SUNDAY FLOW CIRCLE
18:00-19:30
​18:00-18:15: Arrival (quiet time, no forced socializing)
18:15-18:30: Check-in (each person 2 minutes max)
18:30-19:00: Topic discussion (pre-announced: "resource sharing")
19:00-19:15: Action items
19:15-19:30: Closing (free to leave anytime after 19:15)

**Why this works:** No surprises. You know exactly what to expect.

---

**2. Written Communication Option**

**What helps:**
- Text-based check-ins (not just verbal)
- Shared document for thoughts
- No pressure to speak aloud

**Example:**

Instead of:  
"Everyone share how you're feeling right now"

Try:  
"Write your check-in or speak it – both are fine"

**Why this works:** Processing verbally under pressure is exhausting. Writing gives time to think.

---

**3. Sensory Accommodations**

**What helps:**
- Dimmer lights (or option to sit in darker corner)
- Quiet space available
- No strong smells (perfume, incense, candles)
- Fidget-friendly (stimming welcome)
- Headphones okay during breaks

**Example room setup:**

- Main circle: moderate lighting, cushions
- Side room: dim, quiet, alone space
- Fidgets available (stress balls, spinners, clay)

**Why this works:** Sensory overload prevents participation. Accommodation enables it.

---

**4. Right to Leave/Stim/Regulate**

**Explicit permission:**

> "You can:  
> - Leave anytime without explanation  
> - Stim (rock, pace, fidget)  
> - Go non-verbal (use notebook/phone)  
> - Take breaks  
> - Lie down if needed"

**Why this works:** Masking is exhausting. Permission to be yourself is liberating.

---

**5. Explicit Social Rules**

**Write down:**

- Can I interrupt? (No, unless urgent)
- Can I leave early? (Yes, always)
- How do I say no? (Just say "no" – explanation optional)
- How do I ask for help? (Text, verbal, note – all fine)

**Why this works:** Implicit social rules are hell. Explicit rules are relief.

---

## PART II: ADAPTATIONS FOR ADHD FOLKS

### What ADHD Brains Often Need:

**1. Body-Doubling for Tasks**

**What it is:** Working alongside someone, not necessarily talking.

**How to use in Circle:**

"ADHD Work Sessions" – meet to do parallel tasks:
- One person pays bills
- Another cleans room
- Another writes emails

**Together. Silently (mostly).**

**Why this works:** ADHD brains focus better with another person present.

---

**2. Flexible Deadlines**

**What helps:**
- "Soft" deadlines (suggested, not enforced)
- Check-ins without shame
- Accountability without punishment

**Example:**

Instead of:  
"You must contribute by Friday or you're out"

Try:  
"We're aiming for Friday. If you can't make it, tell us – we'll adjust."

**Why this works:** Pressure creates freeze. Flexibility creates movement.

---

**3. Hyperfocus Celebrated (Not Exploited)**

**What helps:**
- Recognize when someone is hyperfocused
- Don't interrupt unless urgent
- Don't expect them to do other things during hyperfocus
- Celebrate deep work

**But also:**

**Protect from exploitation:**

If someone hyperfocuses on Circle tasks:
- Check in: "Are you okay? Do you need to stop?"
- Set boundaries: "You've done enough. Rest now."

**Why this works:** Hyperfocus is gift, but ADHD folks can burn out by not stopping.

---

**4. Movement Welcome**

**What helps:**
- Walking meetings (if able)
- Standing/pacing during discussions
- Fidgeting without judgment
- Breaks every 30-45 minutes

**Example:**

"Circle Walk" – go for walk while discussing topic.

Or:

"10-minute break every hour – move your body however feels good"

**Why this works:** ADHD brains think better when moving.

---

**5. Reminders Without Shame**

**What helps:**
- Text reminders before meetings
- Gentle check-ins (not nagging)
- "I forgot" is acceptable reason

**Example:**

Instead of:  
"You forgot AGAIN?"

Try:  
"Hey, meeting in 30 min – see you there or no worries if you can't make it"

**Why this works:** ADHD time blindness is real. Shame doesn't help. Reminders do.

---

## PART III: ADAPTATIONS FOR TRAUMA SURVIVORS

### What Traumatized Nervous Systems Often Need:

**1. No Forced Vulnerability**

**What helps:**
- Sharing is optional
- "Pass" is always allowed
- No pressure to "open up"

**Example:**

Circle asks: "Share how you're feeling"

**Acceptable answers:**
- Full emotional share
- "I'm okay"
- "Pass"
- *silence*

**All are honored.**

**Why this works:** Forced vulnerability is re-traumatizing.

---

**2. Consent-Based Everything**

**What helps:**

**Before touching:** "Can I hug you?" (not assumed)

**Before intense topics:** "We're going to discuss [difficult thing]. Anyone need to leave?"

**Before sharing others' stories:** "Can I share what you told me?" (never assumed)

**Why this works:** Trauma survivors need control over body and information.

---

**3. Pacing Respected**

**What helps:**
- Slow is okay
- Processing time honored
- No rush to "get over it"

**Example:**

Someone shares hard thing.

**Don't say:** "Have you tried just moving on?"

**Do say:** "Take all the time you need. We're here."

**Why this works:** Healing has no timeline.

---

**4. Triggers Acknowledged**

**What helps:**
- Content warnings before difficult topics
- Option to leave without explanation
- No shame for being triggered

**Example:**

"Today we might discuss financial stress. If that's hard for you, feel free to step out or stay quiet."

**Why this works:** Triggers are real. Accommodation prevents re-traumatization.

---

**5. Safety Signals**

**What helps:**

**Physical:**
- Weighted blankets available
- Comfortable seating
- Exit always accessible

**Emotional:**
- Predictable people
- No sudden changes
- Slow introductions of new members

**Why this works:** Nervous system needs safety cues to regulate.

---

## PART IV: BUILDING NEURODIVERGENT-FRIENDLY CIRCLES

### Communication Norms

**Write these down and share with everyone:**

1. **Multiple communication modes welcome** Verbal, written, gesture, silence – all valid

2. **No mind-reading expected** Say what you need. Ask if unclear.

3. **"I don't know" is complete sentence** You don't need to explain everything.

4. **Silence is okay** Pauses are fine. No pressure to fill space.

5. **Disagreement is okay** You can say no, disagree, or opt out.

---

### Meeting Structure

**Accessible format:**

**Before meeting:**
- Agenda shared 24 hours ahead
- Reminder sent 2 hours before
- Opt-out option always available

**During meeting:**
- Start/end times respected
- Breaks built in
- Movement allowed
- Written option for sharing

**After meeting:**
- Notes shared within 24 hours
- Action items clear and optional
- Check-in available (not required)

---

### Conflict Resolution

**Neurodivergent-aware approach:**

**1. Pause (longer than neurotypical default)**

Give 48-72 hours, not 24.

**2. Written option**

Don't force verbal confrontation.

Email/text conflict resolution is valid.

**3. Mediator available**

Third party to help translate between different processing styles.

**4. No forced reconciliation**

Sometimes people need distance. That's okay.

---

### Rest Protocols

**Explicit rest permission:**

> "You are allowed to:  
> - Cancel last minute  
> - Take weeks off  
> - Participate less when exhausted  
> - Rest without guilt"

**No explanation needed.**

**Baseline is protected regardless.**

---

## PART V: SPECIFIC SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Autistic Person Overwhelmed at Meeting

**What happened:**

Person A suddenly leaves mid-meeting.

**Neurotypical response (unhelpful):** "Are you okay? What's wrong? Come back!"

**Neurodivergent response (helpful):** *Let them leave.*

Text later:  
"Hey, you left. No worries. Need anything?"

**If they share:** "Too loud/too many people/needed quiet"

**Response:** "Totally valid. See you next time or take a break – both fine."

---

### Scenario 2: ADHD Person Forgot Important Task

**What happened:**

Person B was supposed to bring food. Forgot.

**Neurotypical response (unhelpful):** "You always forget! We were counting on you!"

**Neurodivergent response (helpful):** "No worries. ADHD tax. We'll figure out food. Want a reminder system for next time?"

**Then:**

Set up calendar reminder or buddy system.

---

### Scenario 3: Traumatized Person Triggered

**What happened:**

Person C starts crying during discussion of debt.

**Neurotypical response (unhelpful):** "It's okay! Don't cry! Let's fix it!"

**Neurodivergent response (helpful):** *Offer quiet space.*

"Want to step out? We can pause. Or continue and you rest?"

**Their choice.**

---

## PART VI: SELF-ADVOCACY TEMPLATE

**For neurodivergent folks joining a Circle:**

**Share this with your Circle:**

> "Hi, I'm [name]. I'm [autistic/ADHD/traumatized/etc].
>
> This helps me participate:  
> - [Example: I need agendas ahead of time]  
> - [Example: I might leave suddenly – not personal]  
> - [Example: I process slowly – give me time]
>
> If I'm struggling, this helps:  
> - [Example: Text me instead of calling]  
> - [Example: Let me have quiet space]  
> - [Example: Don't ask me to explain – just accommodate]
>
> Thanks for making space for me."

**This is not demanding.** **This is advocating for yourself.**

**Good Circles will thank you for clarity.**

---

## FINAL WORDS

**Neurodivergent folks are not broken.**

**The Circle is broken if it can't hold us.**

**So we build Circles that:**
- Adapt to our brains
- Honor our needs
- Celebrate our differences
- Protect our rest

**You belong in Flow.**

**Not despite being neurodivergent.** **Including being neurodivergent.**

**Welcome home.**
