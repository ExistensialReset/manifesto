## 1. What is DIVINE Status of Mind? 🤔💖

DIVINE is your **living field** 🌱—your body, social connection, intellect, existential vitality, and grace (Ψ = L × S × I modulated by EV and Σ).  

It’s **not** a religion, a therapy, or a score to chase—it’s a **compass for being truly alive**.  

Think of it as:  
- **L**: Physical vitality & somatic presence 🫀  
- **S**: Social/emotional resonance 🤝  
- **I**: Intellectual curiosity & flow 🧠  
- **EV**: Existential value alignment 🌌  
- **Σ**: Grace & spontaneous wonder ✨
