---

## 💰 PHASE 2: ECONOMIC COORDINATION (Month 10-18)

- People want to deepen
- Economic pressure is high (rent, food costs)

---

### **Month 10: Choose Economic Model**

📖 **Read:** MICRO-ECONOMY_GUIDE.md

✅ **Do:** Decide which model fits your group

**The 3 Models:**

**Model 1: Pooled Fund** (full sharing)
- Everyone puts money in one pot
- All shared expenses paid from pot
- High trust required
- Best for: 3-5 people, long-term commitment

**Model 2: Split Bill** (proportional by income)
- Shared expenses divided by income percentage
- Feels fair (richer pay more)
- Requires income transparency
- Best for: 5-10 people, mixed incomes

**Model 3: Solidarity Network** (opt-in help)
- Everyone manages own money
- Help given when someone asks
- No repayment expected
- Best for: Loose groups, transition phase

📝 **Output:** Chosen model documented

---

### **Month 11-12: Implement Model**

📖 **Read:** ECONOMIC_TRANSITION_TOOLKIT.md

✅ **Do:**

**For ALL models:**
1. **Baseline Audit** for each person
   - Essential costs (food, rent, healthcare, transport)
   - Optional costs (hobbies, travel, savings)

2. **Resource Mapping**
   - Who has: tools, skills, space, time, money
   - Who needs: same categories

3. **Transparency Ledger** (start now!)
   - Track all contributions (money, labor, goods)
   - Update weekly
   - Example:

| Date | Person | Contribution | Type | Notes |
|------|--------|--------------|------|-------|
| Feb 1 | A | 6,000 kr | Money | Rent share |
| Feb 1 | B | 4,000 kr | Money | Rent share |
| Feb 3 | C | 4 hours | Labor | Repaired heating |
| Feb 5 | D | 1 bag rice | Food | Bulk buy |

**For Model 1 (Pooled Fund):**
- Open shared bank account (or cash envelope)
- Decide contribution schedule (monthly? bi-weekly?)
- Track all shared expenses

**For Model 2 (Split Bill):**
- Calculate each person's share
- Example (from MICRO-ECONOMY_GUIDE):
  - 5 people, total rent 21,000 kr
  - Person A earns 28,000 → pays 8,055 kr
  - Person B earns 16,000 → pays 4,603 kr
  - Person C earns 12,000 → pays 3,452 kr
  - Person D earns 9,000 → pays 2,589 kr
  - Person E earns 8,000 → pays 2,301 kr

**For Model 3 (Solidarity Network):**
- Create request system (anonymous box? Signal channel?)
- Decide response protocol (Circle meeting? Individual?)

📝 **Output:** 
- Economic model running
- First month tracked in Transparency Ledger

---

### **Month 13-18: Stabilize & Expand**

  - Physical resource pool (tools, emergency supplies)

- **Bulk & Cooperative Buying**
  - Identify recurring needs (food staples, hygiene)
  - Purchase collectively
  - Rotate storage/distribution

- **Skills-for-Resource Matching**
  - Person A cooks → saves everyone else time/money
  - Person B repairs bikes → saves everyone transport costs
  - Track in Transparency Ledger (labor = value)

- **Monthly Money Meeting** (MICRO-ECONOMY_GUIDE)
  - Review Transparency Ledger
  - Celebrate surplus
  - Adjust model if needed

📝 **Output:**
- Circle sustains 10-20% of members' Baselines
- Economic model stable for 6+ months

---

### **End of Phase 2 Checklist:**

✅ Economic model chosen and implemented  
✅ Transparency Ledger maintained  
✅ 10-20% of Baseline covered by Circle

## 🌊 FINAL NOTES

### **This is a GUIDE, not a LAW**

Your journey will be different.

**You might:**
- Take longer (totally fine)
- Skip steps (if you have resources/skills)
- Get stuck (normal, adjust)
- Dissolve and restart (also normal)

**What matters:**
- Are Baselines more secure?
- Is Calm (L) increasing?
- Is Spontaneity (S) returning?
- Is Interconnection (I) deepening?

If yes: **You're doing Flow.**

---

### **When to use this roadmap:**

**Weekly:** Check current phase, do monthly actions  
**Monthly:** Review progress, adjust timeline  
**Quarterly:** Big-picture check-in  
**Yearly:** Compare to original goals

---

### **When NOT to use this roadmap:**

**If it creates stress:** Slow down  
**If it feels forced:** Adjust  
**If it's not serving Life:** Change it

**Remember:**

> Flow measures life by aliveness, not longevity.  
> A Circle that exists joyfully for 6 months has succeeded.  
> A Node that grinds people down for 10 years has failed.

---

**Go gently.**  
**Build slowly.**  
**Live now.**

🌊💚✨
