**Status:** Practical Guide for Closures and Departures  
**Purpose:** To ensure that every ending is a source of nourishment for the future.  
**Principle:** Exit is an act of sovereignty; Failure is nutrient, not shame.

## Preamble: The Ritual of Release

In the world of Mammon, a failed project is a source of shame, bankruptcy, and loss of status. In Flow, we recognize that everything in nature has a season. An ending is simply energy changing form.

If an individual chooses to leave, or if a Circle decides to dissolve, we perform the **Ritual of Release**. We treat the remains of the endeavor as "Compost"—organic matter that must be broken down so that its nutrients (knowledge, tools, and spirit) can feed the next generation of Nodes.

## 1. The Honorable Exit (Individual)

Sovereignty is meaningless without the absolute right to walk away.

- **The Right to Leave:** Any individual may exit a Circle at any time. No explanation is required, though feedback is welcomed as a gift.  
- **The Bridge Baseline:** To prevent a departing member from crashing back into the desperation of the old world, the Circle attempts to provide a "Bridge Baseline" (3 months of essential support) to ensure their transition is made in L (Calm) rather than fear.  
- **Personal Property:** All personal items remain the property of the individual. Shared resources remain with the Flow.

## 2. Circle Dissolution (The Compost Protocol)

If a Circle no longer resonates or can no longer secure its Baseline, it is gracefully decomposed.

- **Post-Mortem of Gratitude:** Members gather to document the "Friction Points." We do not ask "Whose fault was it?" but "Where did the Flow stop?" This data is uploaded to the global repository as a lesson for others.  
- **Seed Dispersal:** Physical infrastructure—tools, solar panels, seeds—is not sold to the highest bidder. It is offered to neighboring Nodes or stored in a "Seed Bank" for the next group in the region.  
- **DNA Upload:** The cultural and logistical successes of the Circle are preserved. Nothing is lost; the "DNA" of the experiment lives on in the collective intelligence of the Protocol.

## 3. Final Principle

We do not cling to structures that have lost their life-force. By allowing things to die with dignity, we make room for the S (Spontaneity) of what comes next. In Flow, the end of one journey is the fertilizer for a thousand others.
