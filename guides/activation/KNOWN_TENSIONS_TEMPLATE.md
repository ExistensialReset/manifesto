# 📝 KNOWN_TENSIONS_TEMPLATE.md
**Purpose:** Living template for Circles to document encountered tensions, actions taken, and lessons learned.  
**Placement:** `/guides/activation/KNOWN_TENSIONS_TEMPLATE.md`

> Each Circle fills this out regularly. Keep it factual, reflective, and actionable.  
> Do not judge individuals; focus on systems, flows, and outcomes.

## REFLECTION PRINCIPLES

- Use **objective, somatic, or flow-based observations** where possible  
- Note both **positive and negative effects**  
- Update **iteratively**; this table is meant to grow with experience  
- Share insights across Nodes to **accelerate systemic learning**  
- Treat **each row as a micro-case study** for continuous design improvement

> **Reminder:** Tensions are signals, not failures.  
> This template **supports sovereignty, reflection, and continuous adaptation**.
