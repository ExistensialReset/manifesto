# SHARED_RESOURCE_CONFLICT.md
**Status:** ACTIVE MEDIATION FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** Navigate conflicts over non-divisible resources while protecting Baseline and dignity  
**Principle:** Scarcity is real. Coercion is never the answer.  

---

## §0. DECISIONAL ETHOS (L × S × I)

All mediation under this protocol is guided by the triad:

**L × S × I = Lugn × Spontanitet × Inkännande**

- Calm: Pause decision-making if panic or stress dominates  
- Spontaneity: Avoid rigid processes that block human creativity  
- Empathy: Ensure all parties feel heard and understood  

No resolution reached in haste or pressure is considered valid.

## §1. RESOLUTION LEVELS

Conflicts over shared or non-divisible resources are approached **gradually, collaboratively, and non-coercively**.

### 1.1 Joint Exploration

Participants explore together:

- Can the resource be shared?  
- Can usage be staggered?  
- Can substitutes or alternatives be found?  

**Practical examples:**  
- Makerspace tool conflict: schedule staggered access, or rotate projects  
- Water allocation: time-based or seasonal division  
- Refugium space: short rotations or booking calendar  

**Role clarity:**  
- All members participate  
- Facilitator ensures process, not outcome  
- Neutral observer can record insights without enforcing decisions

---

### 1.2 Logistical Simulation

Neutral parties (human or AI-assisted) model outcomes:

- Simulate schedules, access, and contingencies  
- Highlight potential conflicts before they occur  
- Provide insights to guide discussion, **not dictate outcomes**  

**Timeframe:** 1–3 days per simulation for critical resources  

---

### 1.3 Regional Mediation

When agreement is stalled:

- Neighboring Circles may offer **non-binding recommendations**  
- Focus on perspective, not authority  
- Listening is expected; compliance is voluntary  

**Trigger:** Activate only if Joint Exploration + Simulation do not resolve tension within 7–14 days  

---

### 1.4 Structured Coexistence

When resolution is impossible:

- Lottery for equitable access  
- Temporal division (e.g., alternating seasons or years)  
- Shared stewardship with clearly bounded responsibilities  

**Principle:** Choosing to coexist with tension is preferable to domination  

---

## §2. THE WATER AXIOM

**Baseline access to water for drinking, sanitation, and basic life maintenance is non-negotiable.**

- Circles may not compete for, restrict, or weaponize access  
- Violation = immediate escalation to Circle Council or regional support  

**Linkages:** See [ECOLOGICAL_AXIOM_ACTIVATION.md](../activation/ECOLOGICAL_AXIOM_ACTIVATION.md) for guidance on resource stewardship  

---

## §3. FOLLOW-UP & DOCUMENTATION

- Each resolution attempt must be **documented** in Circle logs  
- Include: date, parties involved, decisions considered, final outcome  
- Review monthly to track recurring issues and prevent escalation  
- Reference [SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL.md](./SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL.md) if crisis states are involved  
- Reference [BASELINE_GUIDES.md](./BASELINE_GUIDES.md) to ensure no Baseline is compromised  

**Check-in:** Ensure all parties feel heard and dignity maintained  
**Escalation triggers:** Any threat to Baseline, repeated harm, or coercion

## §4. QUICK REFERENCE CHECKLIST

**1. Calm first** – Pause if emotions are high  
**2. Joint Exploration** – Explore sharing, staggering, or substitutes  
**3. Logistical Simulation** – Model options without prescribing  
**4. Regional Mediation** – Seek perspective only, no coercion  
**5. Structured Coexistence** – Lottery, rotation, or bounded sharing  
**6. Baseline Check** – Protect water and other life-sustaining resources ([see Baseline Guides](./BASELINE_GUIDES.md))  
**7. Documentation** – Log decisions, outcomes, and reflections  
**8. Review** – Monthly check for recurring patterns ([see Severe Mental Illness Protocol](./SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL.md))  
**9. Ecological Oversight** – Confirm resource management aligns with [Ecological Axioms](../activation/ECOLOGICAL_AXIOM_ACTIVATION.md)  

> Use this checklist before making any final allocation decisions.

## §5. CLOSING PRINCIPLE

This protocol **does not promise harmony**.  
It promises **restraint, dignity, and humanity**.  

> The measure of a system is not how fast it decides,  
> but how human it remains while deciding.
