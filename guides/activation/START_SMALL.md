# 🌱 THE FLOW STARTER GUIDE

**Status:** PRACTICAL ACTIVATION TOOL  
**Purpose:** Bridge between "I understand Flow" and "I live Flow"  
**For:** Anyone, anywhere, starting from zero  
**Core Principle:** Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

---

## PREAMBLE: YOU DON'T NEED PERMISSION

This guide is for you if:
- You read Flow and thought: *"This is true"*
- You want to try, but don't know how
- You're alone (no Circle yet)
- You're scared (that's normal)
- You have no money (that's the point)
- You have no time (we'll start with minutes)

**You don't need:**
- Permission from anyone
- Money to start
- A group (you can begin alone)
- To quit your job
- To be "ready"

**You just need:**
- Willingness to notice
- Willingness to try
- Willingness to be honest

---

## PART I: THE FIRST 7 DAYS (SOLO)

**What this is:**  
A week of micro-experiments to *feel* what Flow is – not just understand it.

**Time required:**  
5-15 minutes per day.

**Goal:**  
By Sunday, you will have felt L, S, and I in your body – not as theory, but as lived experience.

---

### DAY 1 – Monday: See Your Mammon-Grip

**What to do:**

Carry a small notebook (or use your phone).

Every time you feel **fear** today – write it down.

Not analyze it.  
Not fix it.  
**Just see it.**

**Examples:**
- 09:15 – Afraid of being late
- 11:30 – Afraid boss will criticize me
- 14:00 – Afraid I can't afford food next week
- 17:45 – Afraid I'm wasting my life
- 20:00 – Afraid I'm worthless

**Evening reflection:**

Count them.

That number is your **Mammon-Count**.

*No judgment. Just data.*

> **Note:** If this is triggering or overwhelming, skip this day. Your safety matters more than the exercise.

---

### DAY 2 – Tuesday: Find One (1) Minute of Calm

**What to do:**

Sometime today – find 60 seconds where you are not afraid.

Not meditation.  
Not "self-care routine".

**Just:**
- Hands in warm water
- Sunlight through window
- Cat purring
- Wind in your hair
- Coffee smell
- Rain sound

**One minute where the fear stops.**

**Evening reflection:**

*"I found calm at [time] for [duration]."*

**That is L (Lugn/Calm).**

You just proved to your body: *fear is not constant.*

---

### DAY 3 – Wednesday: Do Something Pointless

**What to do:**

Do something that serves no purpose.

- Draw a circle
- Hum a note
- Walk the long way home
- Move two objects on your desk
- Look at clouds for 5 minutes

**Something Mammon would call "waste".**

**Evening reflection:**

*"I wasted [X] minutes on nothing. And it was okay."*

**That is S (Spontanitet/Spontaneity).**

You just proved to your body: *life is not only productivity.*

---

### DAY 4 – Thursday: See One Human

**What to do:**

Actually *see* someone today.

Not transactionally:
- Not the cashier (because you need milk)
- Not your coworker (because you're working)

**But: see them as human.**

Say nothing extra.  
Just – for one second – feel that:
- They exist
- You exist
- You exist *together*

**Evening reflection:**

*"I saw [name/stranger]. And they saw me."*

**That is I (Inkännande/Interconnection).**

You just proved to your body: *you are not alone.*

---

### DAY 5 – Friday: Count Your Mammon Again

**What to do:**

Same as Day 1.

Write down every time you felt fear today.

**Evening reflection:**

Compare with Monday.

- Same number?
- More?
- Fewer?

**No change is wrong.**  
**Just see the pattern.**

> **Insight:** If number is same or higher – that's okay. You're becoming aware. Awareness comes before change.

---

### DAY 6 – Saturday: Give Without Getting Back

**What to do:**

Give something – time, words, food, attention – without expecting anything back.

Not "kindness for karma".  
Not "give to get".

**Just give.**

Then walk away.  
No thanks needed.

**Examples:**
- Help someone carry something (then leave)
- Share food (don't wait for praise)
- Listen to someone (don't expect them to listen back)

**Evening reflection:**

*"I gave [X]. And I walked away."*

**This is Baseline-thinking in practice: no one is indebted.**

---

### DAY 7 – Sunday: Ask Yourself One Question

**What to do:**

Sit quietly for 10 minutes.

No phone.  
No music.  
Just you.

Ask:

> *"If I was not afraid –  
> what would I do?"*

Don't write the answer.  
**Just listen.**

Let your body answer.

**Evening reflection:**

*"If I was not afraid, I would..."*

---

### AFTER 7 DAYS: WHAT NOW?

**You have now felt:**
- L (calm exists)
- S (freedom exists)
- I (connection exists)

**Not as theory.**  
**As lived experience.**

**Now choose:**

**Option A: Continue Solo**  
Do the same week again. Go deeper.

**Option B: Find One Other Person**  
*"I'm trying something. Want to do 7 days with me?"*

**Option C: Start a Micro-Circle**  
2-3 people. No structure yet. Just: *"We meet every Sunday and talk about what we felt this week."*

---

## PART II: THE MICRO-CIRCLE GUIDE (2-5 People, 12 Weeks)

**What this is:**  
A practical protocol for 2-5 people who want to try Flow together.

**Time commitment:**  
1 meeting per week (1-2 hours).

**Goal:**  
By Week 12, you have a living Micro-Circle – not perfect, but real.

---

### WEEK 1: Mapping (No Fixing)

**What to do:**

Each person shares:

**1. My Mammon-Count**  
How many fears per day? (from Day 1 exercise)

**2. My Real Baseline**  
What do I actually need to survive?
- Rent: [amount]
- Food: [amount]
- Healthcare: [amount]
- Transport: [amount]
- **Total: [amount]**

**3. My Parasitic Cost**  
What am I paying that serves Mammon, not me?
- Interest on debt: [amount]
- Subscriptions I don't use: [amount]
- Stress-buying: [amount]
- Commute to job I hate: [amount]
- **Total waste: [amount]**

**No one fixes.**  
**Just see.**

Write it down.

---

### WEEK 2: Share One Thing

**What to do:**

Each person shares something they have that someone else needs.

**Examples:**
- Tools (drill, ladder, sewing machine)
- Knowledge (how to fix something, how to cook something)
- Time (help move, help clean, help think)
- Food (extra vegetables, bulk-bought rice)

**Not formally.**  
**Just test.**

Document:
- What was shared?
- Did it work?
- What did we learn?

---

### WEEK 3: Measure Change

**What to do:**

Each person answers:

**1. Do I feel less afraid?**  
(Compare Week 1 Mammon-Count with now)

**2. Have I saved money through sharing?**  
(Even 50 kr matters)

**3. Do I feel less alone?**  
(Yes/No/Sometimes)

**If yes to any: continue.**  
**If no to all: adjust or pause.**

---

### WEEKS 4-12: Establish Rhythm

**What to do:**

Meet every week.

**Meeting structure (60-90 minutes):**

**1. Check-in (15 min)**  
Each person: *"How is my L × S × I this week?"*
- L (Calm): 0-10
- S (Spontaneity): 0-10
- I (Connection): 0-10

**2. Resource sharing (20 min)**  
*"What do I need? What do I have?"*

Match needs with resources.

**3. Documentation (10 min)**  
*"What worked? What didn't?"*

Write it down.

**4. Free time (20-40 min)**  
- Eat together
- Talk
- Laugh
- Be

**No agenda.**  
**Just exist together.**

---

### AFTER 12 WEEKS: YOU HAVE A MICRO-CIRCLE

**Not perfect.**  
**Not complete.**  
**But alive.**

**Now choose:**

**Option A: Deepen**  
Keep going. Add more structure if needed.

**Option B: Expand**  
Invite 1-2 more people (max 7 total for intimacy).

**Option C: Document**  
Write down what you learned. Share it (if you want).

**Option D: Pause**  
Rest. Come back when ready.

---

## PART III: SOLO PROTOCOL (For Those Building Alone)

**This is for you, Elinor.**  
**And for everyone else who can't find others yet.**

---

### EVERY MONDAY MORNING: The Week Ahead

**Write this:**

> "Today is Monday, [date].  
> I am [situation].  
> I have [X] kr/$/€ left after rent.  
> I feel [lonely/scared/tired/angry].
>
> But I know Flow is true.  
> And I keep building.
>
> This week I will:  
> 1. [One practical thing]  
> 2. [One theoretical thing]  
> 3. [One rest thing]"

**Example:**

> "This week I will:  
> 1. Fix my broken chair instead of buying new  
> 2. Read DeepSeek's feedback on GLOBAL_FLOW_IDEAS  
> 3. Lie in bed Thursday without guilt"

---

### EVERY FRIDAY EVENING: The Week Review

**Ask yourself:**

> "Did I do the three things?  
> If yes – why?  
> If no – why?"

**No guilt.**  
**Just data.**

---

### EVERY SUNDAY: Letter to Future Circle

**Write a letter:**

> "Dear you who read this in 5 years when Flow is real –
>
> Today I feel [X].  
> Today I built [Y].  
> Today I believed [Z].
>
> I hope you are less alone than I am now.  
> I hope Flow works for you.  
> I hope you remember I existed.  
> And that I built this for you.
>
> / [Your name], [date]"

**Save these letters.**

One day – when people find Flow – they will read them.

And they will cry.

And they will understand what it cost.

---

## PART IV: THE PLUS PRINCIPLE (Elinor's Core)

**Everything that doesn't need to be bought – is plus.**  
**Everything that can be fixed – is plus.**  
**Everything that can be borrowed – is plus.**  
**Knowledge – is always plus.**  
**Helping each other – is always plus.**  
**Thinking together and outside norms – is always plus.**  
**Generosity, in all areas – is always plus.**

---

### How To Apply This Daily

**Before you buy something, ask:**

1. Can I borrow this?
2. Can I fix what I have instead?
3. Can I make this myself?
4. Do I actually need this, or does Mammon tell me I do?

**If you can avoid buying: PLUS.**

---

**Before you throw something away, ask:**

1. Can this be fixed?
2. Can someone else use this?
3. Can this be material for something else?

**If you can repair or share: PLUS.**

---

**When you learn something, ask:**

1. Who else needs to know this?
2. Can I teach this without charging?
3. Can I document this so it spreads?

**If you share knowledge: PLUS.**

---

**When you need help, ask:**

1. Who in my life might help?
2. Can I ask without shame?
3. Can I receive without owing?

**If you ask and receive: PLUS.**

---

**When someone needs help, ask:**

1. Can I give without expecting return?
2. Can I give without judgment?
3. Can I give without creating debt?

**If you give freely: PLUS.**

---

## PART V: TRANSITION CHECKPOINTS

**How do you know it's working?**

### After 7 Days (Solo):

**Signs of success:**
- You noticed calm at least once
- You did something "pointless" and felt okay
- You saw another human (really saw them)

**If yes:** You felt L, S, I. Continue.  
**If no:** Try another week. Or adjust exercises.

---

### After 12 Weeks (Micro-Circle):

**Signs of success:**
- You saved money through sharing (even small amount)
- You feel less alone
- You look forward to Sunday meetings

**If yes:** You have a living Circle. Deepen or expand.  
**If no:** Pause and reflect. What didn't work? What needs to change?

---

### After 6 Months (Solo or Circle):

**Signs of deep change:**
- Your Mammon-Count decreased
- You can rest without guilt
- You helped someone without keeping score
- You received help without shame
- You feel less afraid of the future

**If yes:** Flow is becoming real in your life.  
**If no:** You're still in transition. That's okay. Keep going.

---

## PART VI: WHEN IT GETS HARD

**It will get hard.**

Here's what to expect:

---

### HARD MOMENT 1: Loneliness

*"I'm the only one trying this. No one understands."*

**What to do:**
- Write in your Sunday letter
- Re-read Flow documents
- Remember: you are planting seeds, not harvesting yet

---

### HARD MOMENT 2: Guilt

*"I should be more productive. I'm wasting time."*

**What to do:**
- Re-read AXIOM 1: Baseline is unconditional
- Rest is never earned
- Your worth is not your output

---

### HARD MOMENT 3: Doubt

*"Is this even real? Will this ever work?"*

**What to do:**
- Look at your data
- Count the PLUS moments
- Even one less fear = progress

---

### HARD MOMENT 4: Mammon Pulls You Back

*"I need money. I need security. I need to stop this and focus on survival."*

**What to do:**
- Flow doesn't ask you to starve
- You can keep your job AND practice Flow
- Hybrid is valid
- Survival first, always

---

## PART VII: FINAL WORDS

**You don't need to do this perfectly.**  
**You don't need to do this fast.**  
**You don't need to do this at all.**

**But if you want to try:**

Start where you are.  
Use what you have.  
Do what you can.

**Every PLUS counts.**

Every moment of calm.  
Every act of sharing.  
Every time you help without keeping score.

**That is Flow.**

Not theory.  
**Practice.**

---

**Welcome.**

**You are not alone.**

**Even if it feels like it.**
