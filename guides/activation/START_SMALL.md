# 🌱 THE FLOW STARTER GUIDE v2.6

**Status:** PRACTICAL ACTIVATION TOOL  
**Core Principle:** Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. No perfection required.

---

## ⚠️ SAFETY & TRAUMA (Expanded)
**Your safety matters more than any exercise.**
- **Option 1:** Skip Day 1. Start with Day 2.
- **Option 2:** Modify Day 1: Track "moments of relative safety" instead of fear.
- **Option 3:** Do this with a trusted person.
- **Option 4:** Delay Day 1 indefinitely. Flow is about reducing pressure, not adding it.

## Ⅰ. THE QUICKSTART 5 POINTS (The Why)
1. **Baseline is Sacred (No Conditions)** – Because no one should have to earn existence.
2. **No Coercion (Everything Voluntary)** – Because compliance kills spontaneity (S).
3. **Build for Life, Not Systems** – Because optimizing systems kills life.
4. **The Earth is in the Circle** – Because there's no sovereignty on a dead planet.
5. **Small, Local, Alive (No Leaders)** – Because hierarchy is Mammon's favorite tool.

## Ⅱ. THE FIRST 7 DAYS (Highlights)
* **Day 1:** Mammon-Count OR Safety-Tracking.
* **Day 2:** 60 seconds of Calm (L). *Proof: Fear is not constant.*
* **Day 3:** Do something pointless (S). *Proof: Life is not only productivity.*
* **Day 4:** See one human (I). *Proof: You are not alone.*
* **Day 5-7:** Data comparison, Giving, and the Sunday Question: *"If I was not afraid, what would I do?"*

## Ⅲ. MICRO-CIRCLE PROTOCOL (2-5 People)

### WEEK 1 ADDITION: Power Inventory & Boundaries
Each person privately notes:
- **Resources I have** (money, time, skills, space).
- **Power I hold** (education, able-bodied, native speaker).
- **Vulnerability I carry** (trauma, illness, immigration status).
*Purpose: Not to create guilt, but awareness. Awareness prevents invisible domination.*

### THE ANTI-PERFECTION CLAUSE
Flow is about awareness, not purity. If you must buy something for survival, health, or your child—that is STILL Flow. 

### CONFLICT ESCALATION GUIDE
- **Level 1:** Pause-Name-Separate-Return.
- **Level 2:** Facilitated conversation with a third party.
- **Level 3:** Temporary separation (2 weeks).
- **Level 4:** Permanent separation or "Forking" the Circle.
- **Level 5:** Refer to THE_HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL.md.

## Ⅳ. WHEN CIRCLES DISSOLVE
Most Circles dissolve within 6 months. This is normal. It's not failure; it's a season.
**What to do:** Document privately what worked and what didn't. Share anonymously to `/circle_ongoing` if comfortable. Others learn from your experience.

---

## Ⅴ. ACCESSIBILITY FOR DIFFERENT NERVOUS SYSTEMS
- **ADHD:** Use timers, not shame. Accept late arrivals. Document decisions in writing.
- **Autism:** Provide agendas in advance. Allow written communication. Accept stimming/non-eye-contact.
- **Dyslexia:** Audio recordings of documents. Visual summaries.
- **Precarity/Crisis:** If the Circle lacks money to help a member in crisis, focus on **Emotional Triage** and **Network Activation**. Don't let individual failure mask systemic violence.
