# 🌱 THE FLOW STARTER GUIDE v2.0

Status: PRACTICAL ACTIVATION TOOL
Purpose: Bridge between "I understand Flow" and "I live Flow"
For: Anyone, anywhere, starting from zero – including trauma survivors, neurodivergent folks, and people in survival mode
Core Principle: Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. No perfection required.

---

**IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANY STEP ON ANY DAY:**

**Options:**

Try a lighter version tomorrow. 
**Example:** Day 1 felt too hard? Just count 3 fears instead of all.
Skip to next day. 
Some days won't work. That's fine.
Pause the whole week. 
Come back when ready. No expiration date.
**Remember:** Skipping is data, not failure. 

---

## PREAMBLE: YOU DON'T NEED PERMISSION

This guide is for you if:

· You read Flow and thought: "This is true"
· You want to try, but don't know how
· You're alone (no Circle yet)
· You're scared (that's normal)
· You have no money (that's the point)
· You have no time (we'll start with minutes)

## You don't need:

· Permission from anyone
· Money to start
· A group (you can begin alone)
· To quit your job
· To be "ready"
· To be "perfect"

## You just need:

· Willingness to notice
· Willingness to try
· Willingness to be honest
· Permission to pause when needed

---

## ⚠️ SAFETY FIRST – READ THIS IF YOU HAVE TRAUMA, ANXIETY, OR PTSD

If you have experienced trauma, anxiety, panic attacks, or deep depression:

Option 1: Skip Day 1 entirely. Start with Day 2.
Option 2: Modify Day 1: Instead of tracking fear, track "moments of relative safety."
Option 3: Do this guide with a therapist or trusted person.

**Your safety matters more than any exercise.
Flow should heal, not harm.
Listen to your nervous system.**

---

## PART I: THE FIRST 7 DAYS (SOLO)

**What this is:**
A week of micro-experiments to feel what Flow is – not just understand it.

**Time required:**
5-15 minutes per day.

**Goal:**
By Sunday, you will have felt L, S, and I in your body – not as theory, but as lived experience.

---

### DAY 1 – Monday: See Your Mammon-Grip (ALTERNATIVE: Track Safety)

**STANDARD VERSION:**
Carry a small notebook. Every time you feel fear today – write it down.
**Examples:** Afraid of being late, criticism, bills, worthlessness
**Evening reflection:** Count them. That's your Mammon-Count.

**TRAUMA-SENSITIVE ALTERNATIVE:**
***Track moments of relative safety instead.***
**Examples:** 10:30 – Door locked, felt safe. 15:00 – Warm tea, no immediate threat.
**Evening reflection:** "Today I had [X] moments of relative safety."

**Choose what works for YOUR nervous system.**
*Both are valid data.*

---

### DAY 2 – Tuesday: Find One (1) Minute of Calm

**What to do:**

Sometime today – find 60 seconds where you are not afraid.

Not meditation.
Not "self-care routine".

**Just:**

· Hands in warm water
· Sunlight through window
· Cat purring
· Wind in your hair
· Coffee smell
· Rain sound
· Or: Simply noticing your breath for 3 cycles

*One minute where the fear stops.*

**Evening reflection:**

"I found calm at [time] for [duration]."

**That is L (Lugn/Calm).**

***You just proved to your body: fear is not constant.***

#### Linked resource: [REFUGIUM_ANIMA.md](./principles/REFUGIUM_ANIMA.md) – if link don't work: go to /principles and look for this document. This is your future sanctuary. Today you found a micro-refugium.

---

### DAY 3 – Wednesday: Do Something Pointless

**What to do:**

***Do something that serves no purpose.***

· Draw a circle
· Hum a note
· Walk the long way home
· Move two objects on your desk
· Look at clouds for 5 minutes
· Or: Just 
"I wasted [X] minutes on nothing. And it was okay."

**That is S (Spontanitet/Spontaneity).**

You just proved to your body: life is not only productivity.

---

### DAY 4 – Thursday: See One Human

**What to do:**

Actually see someone today.

**Not transactionally:**

· Not the cashier (because you need milk)
· Not your coworker (because you're working)

***But: see them as human.***

Say nothing extra.
Just – for one second – feel that:

· They exist
· You exist
· You exist together

**Evening reflection:**

"I saw [name/stranger]. And they saw me."

**That is I (Inkännande/Interconnection).**

***You just proved to your body: you are not alone.***

#### Linked resource: [GLOBAL_RESONANCE.md](./principles/GLOBAL_RESONANCE.md) – if link don't work, go to /principles, look for the document. This feeling is universal across all cultures.

---

### DAY 5 – Friday: Compare Your Data

**What to do:**

Look at your notes from Monday (or alternative).

**Ask:**

· Has my Mammon-Count changed? (Up, down, same – all okay)
· Or: Have my safety moments increased?

**Evening reflection:**

"This week I learned that fear/safety patterns are [X]."

*No judgment. Just noticing.*

**Insight:** If your fear-count increased – that's often increased awareness, not increased fear. You're noticing what was already there.

---

### DAY 6 – Saturday: Give Without Getting Back

**What to do:**

Give something – time, words, food, attention – without expecting anything back.

Not "kindness for karma".
Not "give to get".

*Just give.*

Then walk away.
No thanks needed.

**Examples:**

· Help someone carry something (then leave)
· Share food (don't wait for praise)
· Listen to someone (don't expect them to listen back)
· Or: Smile at a stranger without needing them to smile back

**Evening reflection:**

"I gave [X]. And I walked away."

***This is Baseline-thinking in practice: no one is indebted.***

---

### DAY 7 – Sunday: Ask Yourself One Question

**What to do:**

Sit quietly for 10 minutes.

*No phone.*
*No music.*
*Just you.*

**Ask:**

"If I was not afraid –
what would I do?"

Don't write the answer.
Just listen.

Let your *body* answer.

**Evening reflection:**

"If I was not afraid, I would..."

***Save this answer. It's important.***

---

### CELEBRATION: You Completed Week 1! 🎉

**Take a moment to recognize:**

· You showed up for yourself
· You experimented
· You gathered data about your own life
· You practiced sovereignty

---

### AFTER 7 DAYS: WHAT NOW?

**You have now felt:**

· L (calm exists)
· S (freedom exists)
· I (connection exists)

Not as theory.
As *lived experience.*

**Now choose:**

**Option A: Continue Solo**
Do the same week again. **Go deeper.** Try the alternative exercises.

**Option B: Find One Other Person**
"I'm trying something. Want to do 7 days with me?"
(Share only what feels safe)

**Option C: Start a Micro-Circle**
2-3 people. No structure yet. Just: "We meet every Sunday and talk about what we felt this week."

**Option D: Digital Solo-Circle**
Join the anonymous online forum (see Appendix A) to share experiences without revealing identity. 

Or just email me, **elinor. frejd@proton.me**, I will answer you, I promise. 

**Option E: HYBRID PATH (Not Ready for Full Circle Yet)**

Not ready for 1-2 hour meetings?
Try this gradual bridge:
Weeks 1-4: Solo + Digital
Continue 7-day solo practice
Post once per week to Digital Solo-Circle (or journal)
Weeks 5-8: Find ONE Other Person
Not a full Circle – just one trusted person
Meet for 20-30 minutes weekly
Share: "How was your week's practice?"
No structure. Just presence.
Weeks 9-12: Decide Next Step
Ready for full Micro-Circle? → Start PART II
Want to stay one-on-one? → That's valid too
Prefer digital/solo? → That's also Flow
Remember: Circles are not mandatory.
Flow can be lived entirely solo if needed.

---

## PART II: THE MICRO-CIRCLE GUIDE (2-5 People, 12 Weeks)

**What this is:**
A practical protocol for 2-5 people who want to try Flow together.

**Time commitment:**
1 meeting per week (1-2 hours).

**Goal:**
By Week 12, you have a living Micro-Circle – not perfect, but real.

---

### SHARING BOUNDARIES AGREEMENT (WEEK 0)

Before you start, agree on:

1. Comfort Levels:
· **🟩Green:** Share everything
 
· **🟨Yellow:** Share some things
   
· **🟥Red:** Share only basics
        
**Everyone chooses their color each week**
2. The Right to Pass:
      "I pass" is a complete sentence. No explanation needed.
3. Confidentiality:
      What's shared in Circle stays in Circle.
4. No Fixing:
      We listen, we don't solve unless asked.

---

### WEEK 1: Mapping with Boundaries

**What to do:**

Each person shares according to their comfort level:

**Level 1 (Red):**
"I'm here. That's all I can share today."

**Level 2 (Yellow):**
"My Mammon-Count this week was between [range]."

**Level 3 (Green):**
Full sharing:

1. My Mammon-Count or safety moments
2. My Real Baseline (rent, food, etc.)
3. My Parasitic Cost (what goes to Mammon)

**Document together:**

· What sharing level felt right?
· What needs adjustment?

---

### WEEK 2: Share with Graduated Trust

**What to do:**

Practice graduated sharing:

1. Share something small and replaceable
      Example: "I have extra rice. Anyone need some?"
2. Notice: Does it feel safe?
3. Next time: Share something a little more valuable
4. Build trust slowly

**Document:**

· What worked?
· Any discomfort?
· How to adjust?

---

### WEEK 3: Measure Change & Celebrate Small Wins

**What to do:**

#### Celebration check-in🎉:

1. Did we meet for 3 weeks? → Celebrate consistency!
2. Did anyone feel less alone? → Celebrate connection!
3. Did we share anything? → Celebrate sharing!

**Progress tracking:**

· Create a simple "Wins Board"
    Examples: "Week 3: Maria shared tools. We all laughed."

**If no wins yet:**
"We showed up. That's a win. Let's adjust next week."

---

#### WEEKLY CHECKPOINT CELEBRATIONS 🎉

**Every 4 weeks, celebrate:**

· Week 4: "We made it one month!" (Share a meal)
· Week 8: "Two months of showing up!" (Small ritual)
· Week 12: "We built something real!" (Reflection ceremony)

**Small celebrations prevent burnout.**

---

### WEEKS 4-12: Establish Sustainable Rhythm

Meeting structure (60-90 minutes):

1. Check-in with Comfort Colors (15 min)
Each person shares color and:
"How is my L × S × I this week?"

· L (Calm): 0-10
· S (Spontaneity): 0-10
· I (Connection): 0-10

2. Resource sharing with Graduated Trust (20 min)
"What do I feel safe offering? What do I need?"

3. Documentation & Learning (10 min)
"What worked? What didn't? How do we adjust?"

4. Free time – NO AGENDA (20-40 min)

· Eat together
· Talk
· Laugh
· Sit in silence
· Just exist together

---

#### CONFLICT PROTOCOL FOR MICRO-CIRCLES

**If tension arises:**

1. Pause – Stop the discussion
2. Name – "I feel tension around X"
3. Separate – Take space if needed
4. Return – "Can we try again with more care?"

**Remember:** Small circles are practice fields. Conflict is learning material.

---

#### AFTER 12 WEEKS: YOU HAVE A MICRO-CIRCLE

Not perfect.
Not complete.
But alive.

**Now choose:**

**Option A:** Deepen
Keep going. Add more structure if needed.

**Option B:** Expand Carefully. Invite 1 more person. 
Interview them first: "What's your comfort with vulnerability?"

**Option C:** Document & Share
Write down what you learned. Share anonymously online to help others.

**Option D:** Pause & Integrate
Rest for a month. Let learning settle.

**Option E:** Celebrate Completion
Have a ceremony acknowledging what you built.

---

### PART III: SOLO PROTOCOL WITH DIGITAL SUPPORT

For those building alone or between Circles.

---

### APPENDIX A: DIGITAL SOLO-CIRCLE

**What it is:** Anonymous online space to share Flow experiences.

This option doesn't exist yet, because I don't know how to build a website, and I don't have any money to build it for either... But! I have an email and you can write me your thoughts every day or week and 

I will publish it hear on this github repo, anonymously of course, under a new map that is called /circle_experiences 

My email is elinor.frejd@proton.me 

 Read others' shares
 No replies, no advice – just witnessing

**Safety rules:**

· No personal details
· No asking for money, no use, I have no money...
· No giving advice unless tag says "[Advice Welcome]"

---

### EVERY MONDAY MORNING: The Week Ahead

**Write this:**

"Today is Monday, [date].
I am [situation].
I have [X] kr/$/€ left after rent.
I feel [emotion(s)].

But I know Flow is true.
And I keep building.

**This week I will:**

1. [One practical thing – small]
2. [One learning thing – 10 min max]
3. [One rest thing – guilt-free]

**Permission slip:**
I may not complete all three. That's okay."

**Example:**

"This week I will:

1. Fix one broken thing
2. Read one section of DIVINE.md
3. One afternoon nap without guilt

**Permission:** It's okay if I only do one."

---

### EVERY FRIDAY EVENING: The Week Review

**Ask yourself:**

"What did I actually do?
What felt good?
What felt hard?

No guilt. Just curiosity."

Then email me and I will post anonymously to /circle_ongoing:
"Week [X]: I did [Y]. It felt [Z]."

---

### EVERY SUNDAY: Letter to Future Circle

**Write a letter:**

"Dear you who read this in 5 years when Flow is real –

Today I feel [X].
Today I built [Y].
Today I believed [Z].

I'm scared sometimes.
I'm alone sometimes.
But I keep building.

I hope you are less alone than I am now.
I hope Flow works for you.
I hope you remember we existed.
And that we built this for you.

/ [Your name or anonymous], [date]"

**Save these letters.**

One day – when people find Flow – they will read them.

And they will understand what it cost.

---

### PART IV: THE PLUS PRINCIPLE – WITHOUT PERFECTION

Everything that doesn't need to be bought – is plus.
But sometimes you buy things – and that's still okay.

---

### THE ANTI-PERFECTION CLAUSE

Flow is not about being perfectly anti-consumerist.
Flow is about awareness and choice.

Before you buy something, ask:

1. Can I borrow this?
2. Can I fix what I have instead?
3. Can I make this myself?
4. Do I actually need this, or does Mammon tell me I do?

If you answer NO to all four – AND YOU BUY IT:
That's still Flow. Because you chose consciously.

Flow is conscious choice, not perfect purity.

---

### PLUS PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE – GRADUATED

Start with **Level 1 (Easy):**

· Borrow a book instead of buying
· Fix one broken item this month
· Share extra food once

Move to **Level 2 (Medium):**

· Start a tool-sharing agreement
· Learn one repair skill
· Join a food-sharing group

**Level 3 (Deep):**

· Radical resource sharing
· Community skill banks
· Gift economy participation

You choose your level. All are valid.

---

### WHEN PLUS FEELS LIKE PRESSURE

If you ever feel:

· "I should always share"
· "I should never buy new"
· "I'm not Flow enough"

**Stop.** Read this:

"Flow is about reducing fear, not increasing guilt.
If PLUS thinking makes you afraid or guilty,
you're doing Mammon's work for him.
Take a step back.
Breathe.
Start smaller.
Or don't start at all today.
Your worth is not your anti-consumption score."

---

### PART V: TRANSITION CHECKPOINTS WITH VISUAL TRACKING

Track your progress simply:

**SOLO TRACKER** (Example)

```
Month 1: 🟡🟡⚪⚪⚪ (2 calm days out of 5)
Month 2: 🟡🟡🟡⚪⚪ (3 calm days)
Month 3: 🟡🟡🟡🟡⚪ (4 calm days)
```

**CIRCLE TRACKER**

```
Week 1-4: ⚪⚪⚪⚪ (Forming)
Week 5-8: 🟡⚪⚪⚪ (1 consistent sharing)
Week 9-12: 🟡🟡⚪⚪ (2 consistent sharings)
```

**CELEBRATION THRESHOLDS**

· Small win: 7 days of any practice → "I practiced for a week!"
· Medium win: 1 month of weekly Circles → "We built consistency!"
· Big win: 3 months with reduced Mammon-Count → "I'm changing patterns!"

**Celebrate what IS, not what "should be."**

---

### PART VI: WHEN IT GETS HARD – EXPANDED SUPPORT

It will get hard. Here's your toolbox:

---

#### HARD MOMENT 1: Loneliness

"I'm the only one trying this."

**Toolbox:**

· Write in your Sunday letter
· Post to Digital Solo-Circle
· Re-read [GLOBAL_RESONANCE.md] – others feel this too
· Remember: You're planting seeds. Harvest comes later.

Or just write me an email. elinor.frejd@proton.me 
I will surely cheer you up! 

---

#### HARD MOMENT 2: Guilt & Perfectionism

"I should be better at this."

**Toolbox:**

· Re-read ANTI-PERFECTION CLAUSE (above)
· Say aloud: "Flow is progress, not perfection"
· Look at your tracker – any progress counts
· Remember: Mammon wants you guilty. Don't help him.

---

#### HARD MOMENT 3: Doubt

"Is this even real?"

**Toolbox:**

· Look at your data (Mammon-Count changes?)
· Read your Sunday letters (see your own growth)
· Re-read [AXIOMS.md] – this is built on solid ground
· Ask: "Do I feel ANY less afraid than before?" (Even 1% counts)

---

#### HARD MOMENT 4: Mammon Pulls You Back

"I need to stop this and focus on survival."

**Toolbox:**

· First: Survive. Always survive first.
· Flow works alongside survival
· Keep one tiny practice (5 minutes Sunday)
· Hybrid is valid: Mammon job + Flow practice = still Flow

---

#### HARD MOMENT 5: Circle Conflict

"This is getting tense."

**Toolbox:**

· Use Conflict Protocol (above)
· Re-read [THE_HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL.md] for serious issues
· Remember: All human groups have conflict. It's practice.

---

#### HARD MOMENT 6: Burnout

"I'm tired of trying."

**Toolbox:**

· **Stop.** Really stop.
· Minimum maintenance: 1 Sunday letter per month
· Re-read [REFUGIUM_ANIMA.md] – rest is sacred
· **Remember:** Flow includes stopping. Always.

---

---

### PART VIII: FOR PARENTS & CAREGIVERS

Flow with children looks different:

Modified 7 Days with Kids:

Day 1: Notice when your child feels safe (not you)
Day 2: Find 1 minute of calm WITH your child
Day 3: Do something pointless TOGETHER
Day 4: See each other fully (parent sees child, child sees parent)
Day 5: Notice patterns in family fear/safety
Day 6: Give freely within family (no "you owe me")
Day 7: Ask child: "What would we do if we weren't afraid?"

**Key adaptations:**

· Shorter time frames (1-5 minutes)
· More physical, less verbal
· Lead by example, not instruction
· Always prioritize child safety over exercises

---

#### PART IX: FINAL WORDS – REVISED

You don't need to do this perfectly.
You don't need to do this fast.
You don't need to do this at all.

But if you want to try:

**Start where you are.**
Use what you have.
Do what you can.
**Stop when you need to.**

***Every conscious choice counts.
Every moment of awareness.
Every tiny act of sharing.
Every breath taken without guilt.***

**That is Flow.**

Not theory.
Practice.
Imperfect, human, alive practice.

---

Welcome.

You are not alone.

Even if it feels like it.
