## Purpose

This toolkit provides practical guidance for reducing economic friction and securing participant **Baseline** during a Flow pilot. It is designed to be used in conjunction with **TRANSITION_PROTOCOL.md** and **PROTOCOL.md**.

> The goal: support each participant’s survival and freedom while minimizing dependency on coercive systems (“Mammon-logic”).

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Baseline Security First** – Always prioritize shelter, food, health, and essential resources.
2. **Shared Risk, Distributed Load** – Avoid placing financial or operational pressure on a single individual.
3. **Transparency** – All costs, contributions, and resource allocations are openly documented.
4. **Local & Bioregional** – Prioritize resources and services that are nearby, resilient, and sustainable.
5. **Iterative Adaptation** – Update practices weekly as learnings emerge.

---

## 2. Participant Assessment

Before any economic coordination:

1. **Baseline Audit:** Document each participant’s essential costs and obligations.
2. **Resource Mapping:** Identify existing assets (housing, skills, tools, networks).
3. **Vulnerability Check:** Highlight participants at risk of losing essential Baseline within the pilot timeframe.

---

## 3. Coordination Practices

### 3.1 Resource Pooling

- Shared fund for essential expenses (food, transportation, utilities)
- Physical resource pool: tools, equipment, first aid kits, emergency supplies
- Allocation based on need, not contribution

### 3.2 Micro-Exchange System

- Non-coercive credit for labor or service contributions
- Transparent ledger (digital or physical)
- Optional exchange with other Circles

### 3.3 Bulk & Cooperative Buying

- Identify recurring needs (food staples, hygiene products)
- Purchase collectively for cost reduction
- Rotate storage and distribution responsibilities

### 3.4 Skills-for-Resource Matching

- Map participant skills to essential services (cooking, transport, maintenance)
- Offer labor credits instead of cash where feasible
- Encourage multi-role contributions for redundancy

---

## 4. Emergency Protocols

- **Immediate support** for Baseline failure: see **EMERGENCY_SAFEGUARDING.md**
- Temporary reallocation of pooled resources
- Daily check-ins for participants under acute stress
- Document interventions for post-pilot evaluation

---

## 5. Monitoring & Feedback

- Weekly review of expenditures, contributions, and allocations
- Track **Baseline security percentage** per participant
- Adjust micro-exchange rates, pool contributions, and skill assignments as needed

---

## 6. Scaling & Integration

- Use the toolkit for up to 20 participants without modifications
- For larger Circles:
  - Subdivide into smaller economic clusters
  - Assign coordinators per cluster
  - Merge cluster data at pilot-level weekly meetings

---

## 7. Documentation

- Maintain a ledger (digital or paper) of:
  - All shared expenses
  - Resource loans and returns
  - Labor contributions and credits
- Document lessons learned for **KNOWN_TENSIONS.md**

---

## 8. Ethical Reminder

- No participant should be coerced into giving more than they can safely contribute
- Prioritize **mutual aid** over profit or accumulation
- Recognize that **security of Baseline is freedom** – not status, hierarchy, or debt
