## Preamble: Gentle Evening Reflection

In the old world, success was measured with numbers: bank balances, “likes,” or productivity hours. These are abstractions that often mask exhaustion.  

In Flow, we return to the source: **your own nervous system**. This checklist is **not a test**, nor a task. Use it as a **gentle evening reflection** to tune in with yourself and your Circle. Flow is functioning when the body shifts from survival (tension) to social engagement and creative rest.

## 1. The Somatic Audit

Use these prompts once a day in the evening. There are **no right or wrong answers**, only information to support your sovereignty.

### L – Measuring Calm (Lugn)
- **The Breath:** Is your exhale naturally longer than your inhale?  
- **The Jaw:** Is there space between your back teeth, or are you clenching?  
- **The Horizon:** Can you sit for ten minutes without the itch to be productive? Does the future feel like a space to inhabit rather than a threat to manage?

### S – Measuring Spontaneity (Spontanitet)
- **The Impulse:** Did you move your body today just because it felt good—dancing, stretching, walking?  
- **The Spark:** Did you follow a curiosity, even if it seemed “useless”?  
- **The Unplanned:** Could you handle an unexpected change without a spike of adrenaline or panic?

### I – Measuring Innate Empathy (Inkännande)
- **The Gaze:** Can you hold eye contact without feeling the need to “perform” or “protect”?  
- **The Weight:** Can you listen to someone else’s struggle without taking it as your own burden?  
- **The Connection:** Do you feel the ground beneath you as a living presence rather than just a surface to walk on?

## 2. Systemic Indicators (The Circle's Health)

A Circle is in Flow when:  
- **Silence is comfortable:** You can sit together without filling the air with “logistics.”  
- **Laughter is frequent:** Joy emerges naturally from a secure Baseline.  
- **Conflict is soft:** Friction prompts curiosity (“Why are we tensing?”) rather than blame.

## 3. Final Principle

If the body says “No,” the system is not in Flow, regardless of logic.  
**Prioritize nervous system regulation over task completion**, because tasks are meaningful only when born from a state of **L × S × I**.

> Use this checklist **once in the evening**. Let it be a gentle guide, not a performance measure. Notice, reflect, and allow your body and Circle to inform your understanding of Flow.
