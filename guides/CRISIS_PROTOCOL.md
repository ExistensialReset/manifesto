# CRISIS_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Core Principle:** Crisis is Data, not Doomsday

---

## PREAMBLE

Crises test resilience. In Flow, crises are absorbed through **Critical Reserves** and decentralized empathy (Inkännande).  
This protocol protects the Baseline under extreme conditions without permanent coercion.  

All crisis actions are **logged** and reviewed for lessons learned.

## §1. ACTIVATION THRESHOLDS

Crisis Mode is activated when:

1. **Baseline Threat:** >20% of a Node lacks essential resources: food, water, shelter, medical care, or mental stability.  
2. **Systemic Risk:** External events (pandemics, disasters) threaten irreversible collapse.  
3. **Consensus:** 75% agreement among affected Circle members, or a quorum for larger networks.

> Thresholds are **dynamic**: critical reserves, local capacity, and psychological well-being are considered.

## §2. THE ESCALATION STACK

1. **Level 1 (Local)**  
   - Deploy 30% Buffer Reserve  
   - Encourage voluntary sharing of resources and skills  
   - Observe social and mental Baseline

2. **Level 2 (Node)**  
   - AI-assisted logistics to model redistribution scenarios  
   - Temporary asset transfers within the Node  
   - Monitor for stress or conflict among members

3. **Level 3 (Regional)**  
   - Inter-Node coordination  
   - Shared Regional Reserves activated  
   - Collective documentation for review

4. **Level 4 (Bioregional)**  
   - Full transparency of supply chains  
   - Decisions made collectively by representative Nodes  
   - All actions logged for post-crisis learning

5. **Level 5 (Existential / AI-Fast)**  
   - Network operates manually, without AI, to reveal hidden dependencies  
   - Humans lead logistics, problem-solving, and observation  
   - Critical lessons fed back into Flow simulations

## §3. REVERSION

- Crisis measures are **temporary**.  
- Once thresholds are cleared, system **reverts to standard Flow within 72 hours**.  
- Debrief all actions: document successes, failures, and patterns for future resilience.
