# CRISIS_PROTOCOL.md
**Status:** ACTIVE 
**Core Principle:** Crisis is Data, not Doomsday.

## PREAMBLE
Crisis is a test of resilience. In the Flow, crises are absorbed through Critical Reserves and decentralized empathy (Inkännande). This protocol protects the Baseline under extreme conditions without resorting to permanent coercion.

## §1. ACTIVATION THRESHOLDS
Crisis Mode is activated when:
1. **Baseline Threat:** >20% of a Node lacks food, water, or safety.
2. **Systemic Risk:** External factors (pandemic, disaster) risk irreversible collapse.
3. **Consensus:** Requires 75% agreement within the affected Circle.

## §2. THE ESCALATION STACK
* **Level 1 (Local):** Use 30% Buffer Reserve. Voluntary resource sharing.
* **Level 2 (Node):** AI-simulated logistics. Temporary redistribution of assets.
* **Level 3 (Regional):** Inter-Node support. Shared Regional Reserves activated.
* **Level 4 (Global):** Bioregional assembly. Full transparency of all supply chain data.
* **Level 5 (Existential):** "AI-Fast." Manual human operation to restore connection.

## §3. REVERSION
Crisis measures are temporary. Once thresholds are cleared, the system must revert to standard Flow within 72 hours.
