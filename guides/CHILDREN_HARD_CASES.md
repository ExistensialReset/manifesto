**Status:** ACTIVE ETHICAL FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** To navigate the tension between child sovereignty and child protection without moralizing, neglect, or coercive overreach  
**Principle:** Love sometimes looks like limits.

## §1. CORE ETHICAL POSITION

Flow-Pedagogy values curiosity, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation.  
However, Flow explicitly recognizes that **addiction is not autonomy**, and that children cannot be expected to self-regulate against systems designed to hijack attention and impulse.

Intervention in cases of harm is **protection, not punishment**.  
Limits are not imposed to control children, but to safeguard their present and future capacity for agency.

---

## §2. POWER & RESPONSIBILITY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Children cannot exit systems.

This creates an ethical asymmetry:  
adults and structures hold power that children do not.

Therefore, any intervention involving limits, separation, or enforced structure must be:
- proportionate
- transparent
- time-bound
- reviewable

Unexamined power is a system failure.

## §3. CHILD VOICE & DIGNITY

In all hard cases:
- the child’s subjective experience must be heard
- the child must be spoken *with*, not merely *about*
- the child must not be framed as “the problem”

Listening to a child does **not** mean transferring responsibility.  
Adults remain accountable for decisions and outcomes.

## §4. CASE PROTOCOLS

### 4.1 The Digital Vortex (Dopamine Addiction)

**Condition:**  
If dopamine-driven activities (screens, gaming, algorithmic media) prevent Baseline health — including sleep, nutrition, movement, or social contact.

**Assessment:**
- Chronic pattern (6+ months) **or**
- Clear signs of escalating harm, regardless of duration

**Protective actions:**
1. Establish clear, explicit limits (e.g., maximum daily use)
2. Communicate the reason for limits in age-appropriate language
3. Offer body-centered, relational alternatives (movement, making, shared activity)

**Review requirement:**  
Limits must be revisited at defined intervals.  
Improvement changes constraints.

---

### 4.2 Persistent Aggression

**Primary rule:**  
Victim safety takes precedence over aggressor autonomy.

If a child repeatedly harms others:
- immediate separation from the group may be required

**Clarification:**  
Separation is a **protective measure**, not a punishment.

**Requirements during separation:**
- continued care and dignity
- therapeutic or sensory support
- a clear path toward safe reintegration

No child is labeled “bad.”  
Unsafe behavior is addressed without identity collapse.

---

### 4.3 Educational Refusal

Curiosity is the preferred driver of learning.  
However, complete absence of foundational skills (literacy, numeracy) limits future autonomy and survival.

**Protective principle:**  
Lack of basic skills is not a neutral choice when the child cannot yet grasp long-term consequences.

**Actions:**
- introduce gentle, proportionate structure
- minimize coercion
- escalate structure only when softer approaches fail

Structure must always serve:
- future agency
- not adult convenience
- not ideological purity

---

## §5. PARENTAL & ADULT ALIGNMENT

When adults disagree on limits or interventions:
- mediation is required
- ideological positions must yield to the child’s well-being

No child may be placed in the crossfire of adult identity, belief, or unresolved conflict.

---

## §6. REVIEW & SAFEGUARDS

All hard-case interventions must include:
- documented rationale
- defined review points
- collective oversight where possible

Prolonged restrictions without review constitute system failure.

---

## §7. FINAL PRINCIPLE

Children deserve:
- protection without humiliation
- limits without fear
- care without abandonment

Freedom without capacity is not freedom.  
Limits without love are not care.

Flow holds both.
