# GLOBAL NODES: Ubuntu and the Khulula Implementation

**The Global South is not "behind"—it is leading the way toward decentralized sovereignty.**

---

## Ubuntu: The Original Protocol
The philosophy *"I am because we are"* is the human foundation of Flow. It recognizes that individual sovereignty (L) is impossible without collective security (Baseline).

---

## The Khulula Project
Khulula is the real-world stress test for these logistics:

* **Mobile-First Logistics:** Using existing decentralized networks (like M-Pesa logic) to bypass legacy banking.
* **Micro-Grids:** Solar and wind production at the village level to secure the Baseline energy needs.
* **Peer-to-Peer Trust:** Replacing credit scores with Social Recognition Systems (SRS).

## Why it Works
In regions where the Mammon-system has already failed, the **Logistical Gravitation** toward Flow is strongest. These nodes are not "aid projects"; they are independent, sovereign hubs.

**Flow is universal. The implementation is local.**
