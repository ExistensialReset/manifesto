# EMERGENCY_SAFEGUARDING.md

## Purpose
This document provides detailed guidance for ensuring the physical, psychological, and existential safety of all participants in Flow pilots and Circles. It is meant to be a practical reference in crisis situations.

---

## 1. Physical Safety

**Immediate actions (call emergency services if necessary):**
- Violence in progress → Call local emergency number (e.g., 112 in Sweden)
- Medical emergency → Call emergency services
- Child or vulnerable adult in danger → Call protective services
- Suicide attempt → Call local crisis hotline

**After immediate danger:**
1. Ensure secure space for affected individuals
2. Notify Circle members if appropriate
3. Document the incident (without violating privacy)

---

## 2. Baseline Threats

A participant’s **Baseline** may be threatened by:
- Job loss
- Eviction
- Medical crisis
- Financial collapse

**Immediate steps (within 24 hours):**
1. Ensure basic needs: food, shelter, medical care
2. Emergency Circle meeting to allocate support
3. Connect to external resources (social services, mutual aid, relevant NGOs)

**Short-term (within 1 week):**
1. Stabilization plan to restore Baseline
2. Distribute support tasks evenly across Circle
3. Daily check-ins until Baseline is stable

---

## 3. Circle Collapse

**Indicators:**
- Multiple participants wish to exit
- Unresolved conflicts threaten Baselines
- Protocols not being followed

**Actions:**
1. Pause the pilot immediately
2. Honest assessment meeting
3. Decide to end or redesign gracefully

**If ending:**
- Settle shared finances
- Return shared resources
- Document learnings
- Part respectfully

## 4. References
- See `PROTOCOL_SAFEGUARDS.md` for systemic safeguards
- See `TRANSITION_PROTOCOL.md` for individual Baseline support pathways
- This document should be reviewed before starting any pilot

**Note:** Pilot "failure" is not personal failure. Following these safeguards ensures dignity, safety, and learning even if the Circle ends.
