# WHEN TO STOP FLOW  
## Exit Criteria and Safe Disengagement

**Guide ID:** FLOW-STOP-v1.0  
**Author:** Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** REQUIRED READING  
**Audience:** Leaders, facilitators, educators, system designers

## 1. Preamble: Flow Is Not Indestructible

Flow thrives in permissive conditions.
It collapses under coercion, misunderstanding, or mismanagement.

Knowing **when and how to stop** is as important as knowing how to start.
Stopping Flow poorly can leave trauma, distrust, and burnout in its wake.

---

## 2. Principle One: Observe the Field, Not Your Agenda

Before you intervene:

- Check: Are people safe, not just compliant?
- Ask: Is the group able to opt out freely?
- Look: Are any signals of distress ignored or suppressed?

Stopping Flow must never be rushed for productivity or convenience.

---

## 3. Principle Two: Communicate Transparently

- Always inform participants: why Flow is ending, what to expect next.
- Avoid vague or abrupt shutdowns.
- Normalize that stopping is part of the process.

Example:

> "We are pausing this session to allow reflection. Take space as needed. There will be follow-up if desired."

---

## 4. Principle Three: Exit Is Optional

- Participation in winding down is voluntary.
- No one should feel judged for stepping away.
- Respect silence, withdrawal, or partial disengagement.

Flow is **inhabited temporarily**; leaving is natural and safe.

---

## 5. Principle Four: Maintain Emotional Containment

- Leaders/facilitators absorb shock, maintain calm.
- Do not outsource distress to participants.
- Hold space for grief, frustration, or relief.

If the field is unstable, stop **slowly**, in stages, with repeated check-ins.

---

## 6. Principle Five: Avoid Artifacts of Optimization

❌ Do not use the stopping phase to:

- Measure participation as a KPI
- Rank disengagement
- Compare readiness or performance
- Push “lessons learned” for productivity gains

Stopping is **for humans**, not for metrics.

---

## 7. Principle Six: Debrief and Reflect Safely

- Offer voluntary spaces for discussion afterward.
- Focus on experiences, not outcomes.
- Ask open-ended questions, e.g.:

> "What did you notice about your own experience?"  
> "Was anything uncomfortable or surprising?"  
> "Is there anything you wish had been different?"

- Avoid judgmental framing; avoid optimization language.

---

## 8. Principle Seven: Document Only for Care, Not Control

- Record what occurred for **supportive follow-up**, not evaluation.
- Avoid data collection for comparison or ranking.
- Keep records confidential and context-aware.

---

## 9. Principle Eight: Recognize Field Signals for Forced Stop

Sometimes, Flow must end abruptly:

- Distress escalates beyond containment
- Safety is compromised
- External events demand pause

In these cases:

- Prioritize **human safety and consent**
- Pause all activities
- Maintain calm and clear communication
- Resume only if conditions normalize

---

## 10. Core Reminder

Flow is **emergent, fragile, and human-centered**.

Knowing **when to stop**, and doing so **safely**, is not failure.  
It is a mark of care, skill, and respect for the system and its participants.

---

## 11. Final Line (Non-Negotiable)

Stopping Flow correctly:

- Protects trust  
- Preserves coherence  
- Ensures the next emergence is safe  

If stopping is handled poorly, the system will remember.  

Care first. Everything else is secondary.
