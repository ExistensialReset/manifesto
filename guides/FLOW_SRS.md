## CORE ASSERTION

**Social Recognition (SRS) MUST NEVER AFFECT BASELINE.**

SRS may only be used for the allocation of **inherently unique, non-replicable resources** — hereafter referred to as **Luxury Resources**.

If SRS ever influences food, housing, healthcare, clothing, internet access, **or any creative tools and spaces**, the system is in violation of Flow principles and must be halted immediately.

---

## §1. WHAT COUNTS AS "LUXURY" IN FLOW

**Luxury is NOT scarcity created by society's failure to provide.**

Luxury is **only what is genuinely, physically unique and cannot be multiplied**.

### 1.1 Creative Tools and Spaces Are BASELINE, Not Luxury

The following are **unconditionally available to all**:

- Rehearsal spaces, music studios, recording equipment
- Makerspaces, workshops, fabrication tools
- Art supplies: paint, canvas, clay, looms, pottery wheels
- Woodworking, metalworking, textile workshops
- Dance studios, theater spaces, film equipment
- Community gardens, tool libraries
- Musical instruments (communal access)
- 3D printers, laser cutters, electronics labs
- Writing spaces, libraries, quiet rooms

**If someone cannot create because a tool or space is unavailable, the solution is to provide more tools and spaces — NOT to ration access through SRS.**

---

### 1.2 What Actually Qualifies as Luxury

Luxury resources are **unique by nature, not by artificial scarcity**:

#### A. Time with Specific People
- Personal mentorship from a particular individual
- One-on-one guidance from someone in high demand
- Collaborative time with a specific artist, thinker, or maker

*(Not workshops in general — those are Baseline)*

#### B. Unique Positional Experiences
- Front-row seats at a sold-out concert
- A specific retreat location with limited capacity
- Participation in a small, intimate gathering

*(Not access to concerts or retreats in general — those are Baseline)*

#### C. Extremely Specialized Equipment with Physical Constraints
- Particle accelerators, space telescopes
- Rare research instruments that exist in single digits globally
- Equipment that requires years of training and cannot be safely shared

*(Not regular labs, studios, or tools — those are Baseline)*

#### D. Unique Handmade Objects
- An original artwork by a specific artist
- A one-of-a-kind crafted item

*(Not reproductions, classes, or access to making your own — those are Baseline)*

### 1.3 The Core Test

Ask these questions:

1. **Can we make more of this?**  
   → If yes, it's Baseline. Make more.

2. **Is this scarce because we haven't prioritized it?**  
   → If yes, it's Baseline. Prioritize it.

3. **Is this unique because of time, place, or personhood?**  
   → If yes, it might qualify as luxury.

4. **Would lack of access to this harm someone's Calm, Spontaneity, or Inclusion?**  
   → If yes, it's Baseline — regardless of scarcity.

---

## §2. WHY SRS MAY BE USED FOR LUXURY — AND ONLY LUXURY

Using SRS for luxury allocation is permissible because:

- No one is harmed by not receiving luxury
- True scarcity (not artificial scarcity) must be handled somehow
- Contribution-based prioritization can feel meaningful *if it is not coerced*

However, this is only safe if SRS is implemented with **strict safeguards**.

---

## §3. DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR SRS-BASED LUXURY ALLOCATION

### 3.1 Domain-Specific Recognition (MANDATORY)

There shall be **no universal SRS score**.

Recognition is always **domain-bound**:

- Artistic contributions → access to unique artistic experiences/mentorship
- Technical contributions → access to rare technical equipment/expertise
- Community care → relational or experiential opportunities

**No cross-domain comparison is allowed.**

A person strong in one domain is not ranked above others globally.

**Critically:** Domain recognition does NOT grant access to domain tools.  
- Musical contribution ≠ access to a rehearsal space (that's Baseline)
- Musical contribution = potential priority for private mentorship with a specific musician (that's luxury)

---

### 3.2 Decay and Non-Accumulation

All SRS used for luxury allocation must **decay over time**.

- Contributions lose relevance naturally
- No permanent elite
- No lifetime priority

**Recommended half-life:** 3–6 months

If recognition does not fade, hierarchy forms.

---

### 3.3 Priority, Not Ownership

SRS does not *grant* luxury.

It only provides:
- Earlier access
- First choice
- Tie-breaking priority

If a resource is unused, it returns to the Circle.

**No one "deserves" luxury. Priority is simply a gentle navigation tool when true uniqueness creates unavoidable limits.**

---

## §4. PAY-IT-FORWARD AS A STRUCTURAL FEATURE

### 4.1 The Right to Pass It On

Any individual granted luxury access through SRS has the **explicit right to redirect it**:

- To another person
- To someone with lower or no SRS
- To someone whose contribution was invisible or informal

This is not charity.  
This is **Flow circulation**.

---

### 4.2 Why Pay-It-Forward Matters

Pay-it-forward:

- Neutralizes status fixation
- Restores human judgment
- Allows ethical correction without bureaucracy
- Rewards generosity as a form of contribution

Passing on luxury **never reduces future recognition**.

In fact, the act of passing forward may itself be recognized as contribution — not as points, but as evidence of Flow thinking.

---

## §5. HOW ALLOCATION ACTUALLY HAPPENS (PRACTICAL FLOW)

### 5.1 Before SRS Is Even Considered

**Step Zero: Eliminate Artificial Scarcity**

Before any use of SRS:

1. Is this resource actually unique, or just undersupplied?
2. Can we build/buy/create more of it?
3. If yes → Do that instead. SRS is not needed.

**Example:**
- "Only 3 pottery wheels for 50 people" → Buy more wheels, expand the studio (Baseline solution)
- "Only 1 month-long residency spot with a specific master potter" → This might warrant SRS (Luxury solution)

---

### 5.2 When True Uniqueness Exists

1. A luxury resource becomes available
2. The relevant domain recognition is consulted
3. A short candidate list is generated (typically 3–5 people)
4. The Circle reviews (lightweight, not bureaucratic)
5. Priority is offered
6. Recipient may:
   - Accept
   - Defer
   - Pay it forward

**At any point, the Circle may override the system if it feels wrong.**

Human judgment outranks metrics.

---

### 5.3 Transparency Without Scorekeeping

People should know:
- Why they were offered something
- What contribution was recognized
- That others might have been considered too

People should NOT know:
- Exact numerical scores
- Rankings or leaderboards
- How they "compare" to others

---

## §6. SAFEGUARDS AND RED LINES

### 6.1 Absolute Prohibitions

SRS must NEVER:

- Affect Baseline (survival, dignity, creative access)
- Grant authority or decision-making power
- Become cumulative across life
- Be visible as a ranked leaderboard
- Be compared across ability, health, or capacity
- Be tracked through surveillance
- **Be used to ration tools, spaces, or materials that could simply be made more available**

If any of the above occurs, SRS must be suspended immediately.

---

### 6.2 Drift Detection (Mandatory Review)

Every 6 months, the Circle asks:

1. Are people optimizing for recognition instead of meaning?
2. Are quiet or caring contributors overlooked?
3. Does anyone feel shame or pressure related to SRS?
4. Does luxury feel deserved *or competitive*?
5. Are we talking more about points than people?
6. **Are we using SRS to ration things we should just provide more of?**

**If 2 or more answers are "yes":**
→ Simplify, soften, or abolish the mechanism.

---

### 6.3 The Baseline Expansion Principle

Whenever SRS is proposed for a resource, ask:

**"Could we just make this available to everyone instead?"**

If the answer is yes, or even maybe:
→ Expand Baseline.
→ Do not use SRS.

**SRS is the last resort, not the first tool.**

---

## §7. WHY THIS DOES NOT RECREATE MAMMON

Mammon logic says:
- Survival is conditional
- Status equals worth
- Accumulation equals virtue
- Scarcity is profitable

Flow logic says:
- Survival is unconditional
- Worth is inherent
- Recognition is contextual and temporary
- **Scarcity is minimized, not managed**
- Luxury circulates

SRS, used only for **genuine, irreducible uniqueness** and with decay + pay-it-forward, **cannot harden into capital**.

---

## §8. EXAMPLES: RIGHT VS WRONG USE

### ❌ WRONG (Violates Baseline)
- Allocating rehearsal space access through SRS
- Rationing art supplies based on contribution
- Limiting makerspace hours by recognition score
- Requiring SRS to use pottery wheels, looms, or tools

### ✅ RIGHT (Genuine Luxury)
- Offering priority for a one-week intensive with a specific master craftsperson
- First choice of a limited artist residency spot in a remote location
- Access to a rare piece of research equipment used by only a handful of institutions globally
- Priority seating at a sold-out premiere performance

---

## §9. FINAL STATEMENT

**SRS is not a score of value.**  
**It is not a rationing system for undersupplied resources.**  
**It is a gentle navigation tool for the genuinely irreplicable.**

If we find ourselves using SRS to allocate creative tools, spaces, or materials:
→ We have failed.
→ The solution is not better allocation.
→ The solution is **more tools, more spaces, more materials.**

**Baseline is sacred.**  
**Creativity is Baseline.**  
**Luxury is rare by nature, not by design.**  
**Recognition must remain human, temporary, and humble.**

---

**STATUS:** Experimental — allowed only for genuine, irreducible uniqueness  
**VALIDATION:** Aligned with Flow axioms and anti-hierarchy safeguards  
**COMMITMENT:** If it harms dignity, limits creativity, or rations what should be abundant — it is removed immediately.
