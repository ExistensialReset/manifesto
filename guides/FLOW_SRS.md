<span style="color:#FF4500">## CORE ASSERTION 🚨</span>

**Social Recognition (SRS) MUST NEVER AFFECT BASELINE.**

SRS may only be used for the allocation of **inherently unique, non-replicable resources** — hereafter referred to as **Luxury Resources**.

> ⚠️ If SRS ever influences food, housing, healthcare, clothing, internet access, **or any creative tools and spaces**, the system is in violation of Flow principles and must be halted immediately.

<span style="color:#1E90FF">## §1. WHAT COUNTS AS "LUXURY" IN FLOW 💎</span>

**Luxury is NOT scarcity created by society's failure to provide.**  

Luxury is **only what is genuinely, physically unique and cannot be multiplied**.

### 1.1 🎨 Creative Tools and Spaces Are BASELINE, Not Luxury

The following are **unconditionally available to all**:

- 🎹 Rehearsal spaces, music studios, recording equipment  
- 🛠 Makerspaces, workshops, fabrication tools  
- 🎨 Art supplies: paint, canvas, clay, looms, pottery wheels  
- 🪚 Woodworking, metalworking, textile workshops  
- 💃 Dance studios, theater spaces, film equipment  
- 🌱 Community gardens, tool libraries  
- 🎸 Musical instruments (communal access)  
- 🖨 3D printers, laser cutters, electronics labs  
- 📚 Writing spaces, libraries, quiet rooms  

> **💡 Principle:** If someone cannot create because a tool or space is unavailable, the solution is to provide more tools and spaces — NOT to ration access through SRS.

### 1.2 💎 What Actually Qualifies as Luxury

Luxury resources are **unique by nature, not by artificial scarcity**:

**A. Time with Specific People**
- Personal mentorship from a particular individual  
- One-on-one guidance from someone in high demand  
- Collaborative time with a specific artist, thinker, or maker  

**B. Unique Positional Experiences**
- Front-row seats at a sold-out concert  
- A specific retreat location with limited capacity  
- Participation in a small, intimate gathering  

**C. Extremely Specialized Equipment**
- Particle accelerators, space telescopes  
- Rare research instruments that exist in single digits globally  
- Equipment requiring years of training  

**D. Unique Handmade Objects**
- An original artwork by a specific artist  
- One-of-a-kind crafted items

### 1.3 🧭 The Core Test

Ask these questions:

1. **Can we make more of this?** → If yes, it's Baseline. Make more.  
2. **Is this scarce because we haven't prioritized it?** → Baseline. Prioritize it.  
3. **Is this unique due to time, place, or personhood?** → Might qualify as luxury.  
4. **Would lack of access harm Calm, Spontaneity, or Inclusion?** → Baseline. Provide access.

---

<span style="color:#32CD32">## §2. WHY SRS MAY BE USED FOR LUXURY 🌿</span>

- No one is harmed by not receiving luxury  
- True scarcity must be handled  
- Contribution-based prioritization can feel meaningful *if it is not coerced*  

> **💡 Safeguard:** SRS is only safe with strict principles.

<span style="color:#FF8C00">## §3. DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR SRS-BASED LUXURY ALLOCATION 🏗</span>

### 3.1 🎯 Domain-Specific Recognition (MANDATORY)

- **No universal SRS score**  
- Always **domain-bound**: Artistic, Technical, Community  
- **No cross-domain comparison**  
- Recognition ≠ tool access (tools are Baseline)

### 3.2 ⏳ Decay and Non-Accumulation

- Contributions naturally lose relevance  
- No permanent elite  
- Recommended half-life: 3–6 months  

### 3.3 ✨ Priority, Not Ownership

- Only earlier access, first choice, tie-breaker  
- Unused resources return to Circle  
- Priority ≠ entitlement  

---

<span style="color:#8A2BE2">## §4. PAY-IT-FORWARD 🔄</span>

### 4.1 The Right to Pass It On
- Redirect luxury access to others  
- Supports Flow circulation, not charity  

### 4.2 Why It Matters
- Neutralizes status fixation  
- Restores human judgment  
- Ethical correction without bureaucracy  
- Rewards generosity as contribution  

> Passing forward **never reduces future recognition**.

---

<span style="color:#00CED1">## §5. PRACTICAL FLOW ALLOCATION ⚡</span>

### 5.1 Step Zero: Eliminate Artificial Scarcity
- Can we make more? → Do that, no SRS needed  
- Examples: Add pottery wheels, expand studios → Baseline  
- 1 unique master potter residency → Might use SRS (Luxury)

### 5.2 True Uniqueness Exists
1. Resource appears  
2. Check domain recognition  
3. Shortlist 3–5 people  
4. Circle reviews lightly  
5. Offer priority  
6. Recipient may accept, defer, or pay forward  

> Human judgment always outranks metrics

### 5.3 Transparency Without Scorekeeping
- Know **why offered** and **what contribution recognized**  
- Do NOT share scores, leaderboards, or global ranking  

---

<span style="color:#FF1493">## §6. SAFEGUARDS & RED LINES 🚫</span>

**Absolute Prohibitions**
- Never affect Baseline  
- Never grant authority  
- No lifetime accumulation  
- No leaderboard visibility  
- No cross-capacity comparison  
- No surveillance  
- No rationing what can be expanded  

**Drift Detection (Every 6 Months)**
- Are people optimizing recognition vs meaning?  
- Are contributors overlooked?  
- Is luxury competitive?  
- Are points more discussed than people?  

> 2+ “yes” answers → Simplify or abolish mechanism

**Baseline Expansion Principle**
> Could we make this available to everyone? → Do that. SRS last resort only.

<span style="color:#FFD700">## §7. WHY THIS DOES NOT RECREATE MAMMON 💡</span>

**Flow vs Mammon Logic**

| Mammon | Flow |
| --- | --- |
| Survival conditional | Survival unconditional |
| Status = worth | Worth inherent |
| Accumulation = virtue | Recognition temporary & contextual |
| Scarcity profitable | Scarcity minimized, luxury circulates |

> SRS w/ decay + pay-it-forward **cannot harden into capital**

---

<span style="color:#ADFF2F">## §8. EXAMPLES: RIGHT VS WRONG ✅❌</span>

**WRONG:**  
- Rationing studio or art supply access  
- Limiting maker hours by SRS  
- Using points to access tools  

**RIGHT:**  
- Priority for 1-week intensive w/ master craftsperson  
- Limited artist residency in remote location  
- Rare research equipment access  
- Priority seating at sold-out premiere  

---

<span style="color:#FF69B4">## §9. FINAL STATEMENT 🏁</span>

**SRS is a navigation tool, not a value score.**  
**Baseline is sacred. Creativity is Baseline. Luxury is rare by nature.**  
**Recognition must remain human, temporary, humble.**

> If SRS ever allocates tools or spaces → solution = more tools, more spaces, more materials.
