# VISUALIZING_TRUTH.md: Visualizing the Reality of Mammon and Flow

You are safe here. This guide helps you **see the hidden losses in the Mammon system** and the potential in Flow through data and charts.

---

## 📊 Why Visualize?

As shown in **[TECHNICAL_ANNEX.md](../technical/TECHNICAL_ANNEX.md)**, Mammon drains **25.5% of our resources** on unnecessary things like marketing and planned obsolescence. Flow recovers this without coercion — see the calculations in **[MAMMON_DRAIN_CALC.py](../technical/MAMMON_DRAIN_CALC.py)**.

Visualizations make the invisible friction tangible, helping us understand the **human cost and opportunity**.

---

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Run the Calculation Script:**  
   Execute **[MAMMON_DRAIN_CALC.py](../technical/MAMMON_DRAIN_CALC.py)** to generate graphs and data outputs.

2. **Integrate the Data:**  
   Use `mammon_drain_chart.json` in your dashboards or web pages to visualize recovered capacity.

3. **Share & Present:**  
   Include PNG charts in presentations or pitches (e.g., **[PITCH_1MIN.md](./PITCH_1MIN.md)**).

## ⚡ Example Impact

Total recovery can provide **1.62x food capacity** — enough for everyone, unconditionally.

Remember the Flow formula: **Life = L × S × I**. Visualizations are not just numbers; they help us **feel the empathy behind the metrics**.
