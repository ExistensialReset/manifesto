# 🏘️ NODE_DEFINITION.md

**Purpose:** To clarify what different levels of Flow organization actually mean.  
**Problem:** People don't know if they're a "Circle," "Baseline Circle," or "Node."  
**Solution:** Clear definitions with concrete criteria.

---

## THE THREE LEVELS

Flow organization exists on a spectrum, not a cliff.

**You don't "become" a Node overnight.**  
**You grow through phases.**

---

## 📍 LEVEL 1: MICRO-CIRCLE (2-5 people)

### **Definition:**
Friends who share resources informally.

### **Duration:**
3 months - 1 year

### **Characteristics:**
✅ No formal structure  
✅ Irregular meetings (weekly or monthly)  
✅ Small resource sharing (meals, tools, transport)  
✅ Emotional support and conversation  
✅ Can dissolve anytime without ritual  

### **Economic model:**
- Mostly individual finances
- Occasional shared purchases
- Gift economy (no tracking)

### **Decision-making:**
- Informal consensus
- No written agreements
- "Let's try this" approach

### **Examples:**
- 3 friends who cook together every Sunday
- 5 neighbors who share a lawnmower and car
- 4 people who meet for weekly forest walks

### **What this is NOT:**
- A commune
- A legal entity
- A commitment for life

### **Exit:**
Just stop coming. No drama needed.

---

## 📍 LEVEL 2: BASELINE CIRCLE (10-30 people)

### **Definition:**
A group that collectively secures Baseline (food, shelter, healthcare, tools) for its members.

### **Duration:**
6 months - 2 years to stabilize

### **Characteristics:**
✅ Regular meetings (weekly or bi-weekly)  
✅ Economic coordination (one of 3 models)  
✅ Resource mapping (who has what, who needs what)  
✅ Written agreements (Sharing Boundaries, Power Inventory)  
✅ Conflict protocols (documented, practiced)  
✅ Exit/Compost protocols  

### **Economic models (choose one):**
1. **Pooled Fund** (full sharing)
2. **Split Bill** (proportional by income)
3. **Solidarity Network** (opt-in help)

### **Decision-making:**
- Consent-based or consensus
- Rotating facilitator
- Documented in shared ledger

### **Infrastructure:**
- Meeting space (rented, borrowed, or Studiecirkel via ABF in Sweden)
- Shared tools/resources
- Communication channel (Signal, shared doc)
- Transparency Ledger

### **Examples:**
- 15 people sharing food costs through bulk buying
- 20 people with shared tool library and childcare co-op
- 12 people pooling money for rent in collective housing

### **What this IS:**
- Serious commitment (but still voluntary)
- Structured mutual aid
- Economic resilience through collaboration

### **What this is NOT:**
- A full Node (not yet)
- Self-sufficient (still relies on external economy)
- Permanent (can dissolve gracefully)

### **Exit:**
Follow EXIT_AND_COMPOST.md protocol:
- 30-day notice
- Bridge Baseline (3 months support)
- Graceful departure ritual

---

## 📍 LEVEL 3: FLOW NODE (30+ people)

### **Definition:**
Full infrastructure for Existential Sovereignty.

A Node guarantees Baseline for all members through internal production, professional support, and inter-Node cooperation.

### **Duration:**
2-5 years to reach this level from zero

### **Characteristics:**
✅ **Professional Team** (healthcare, legal, technical specialists)  
✅ **Volunteer/Research Team** (mentors, artisans, researchers)  
✅ **Lyceum Musaeum** (physical or digital space for learning, workshops, library)  
✅ **Baseline Resource Access** for ALL members:
   - Food (local production + distribution)
   - Energy (solar, wind, or cooperative grid)
   - Tools (maker space, repair café)
   - Healthcare (on-site or coordinated)
✅ **Inter-Node cooperation** (part of regional network)  
✅ **Crisis resilience** (can survive 6 months without external economy)  

### **Economic model:**
- Baseline guaranteed for all
- Surplus shared with regional network
- Minimal external currency dependency (30% or less)

### **Decision-making:**
- Sociocratic circles (working groups with clear mandates)
- Regional coordination via delegates
- Axiom-based governance (AXIOMS.md)

### **Infrastructure:**
- Land or buildings (owned, rented, or squatted)
- Production capacity (gardens, workshops, energy systems)
- Lyceum Musaeum (learning/making space)
- Professional support (nurses, counselors, legal advisors)

### **Examples:**
- 40 people living in collective housing with on-site garden, workshop, and healthcare
- 50 people across 3 buildings coordinating food production, childcare, and elder care
- 35 people on rural land with permaculture, solar power, and repair infrastructure

### **What this IS:**
- A functioning alternative to Mammon
- Existential Sovereignty in practice
- Proof that Flow works

### **What this is NOT:**
- Utopia (conflicts still happen)
- Permanent (Nodes can dissolve)
- Independent (needs regional network)

### **Exit:**
Follow EXIT_AND_COMPOST.md protocol:
- 90-day transition period
- Full Baseline support during transition
- Contribution to Node knowledge base

## 🔄 TRANSITIONS BETWEEN LEVELS

### **Micro-Circle → Baseline Circle**

**Criteria:**
- 8+ consistent members
- Regular meetings for 6+ months
- Economic coordination needed (costs getting too high to manage individually)
- Conflict resolution protocols established

**Process:**
1. Choose economic model (Pooled/Split/Solidarity)
2. Create Sharing Boundaries Agreement
3. Start Transparency Ledger
4. Formalize meeting schedule

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

---

### **Baseline Circle → Flow Node**

**Criteria:**
- 25+ members
- Baseline secured internally for 80%+ of needs
- Professional Team established (or access via regional)
- Physical infrastructure (Lyceum Musaeum, production capacity)
- Inter-Node cooperation active

**Process:**
1. Secure physical space (land, buildings)
2. Build production capacity (food, energy, tools)
3. Establish Professional Team (hire, train, or volunteer)
4. Create Lyceum Musaeum
5. Join regional network
6. Test crisis resilience (can survive 6 months?)

**Timeline:** 2-5 years

## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### **Q: Can we skip Micro-Circle and go straight to Baseline Circle?**
**A:** Only if you have:
- Prior experience with collective living
- 10+ committed people from day 1
- Financial resources to sustain failures
- Strong conflict resolution skills

Otherwise: **No. Start small.**

---

### **Q: How do we know when we're ready to transition?**
**A:** When the current level feels too small for what you're trying to do.

**Signs you've outgrown Micro-Circle:**
- More than 5 people want to join
- Economic coordination is getting messy
- Conflicts need formal resolution

**Signs you've outgrown Baseline Circle:**
- 30+ people involved
- External economy dependency feels limiting
- Regional Nodes asking you for help
- You have physical infrastructure

---

### **Q: Can a Node shrink back to a Circle?**
**A:** Yes. This is not failure.

**Reasons to downsize:**
- Burnout (too ambitious too fast)
- Loss of key members
- External crisis (economic collapse, pandemic)
- Intentional simplification

**Process:** Follow EXIT_AND_COMPOST.md for graceful dissolution, then reform at smaller scale.

---

### **Q: What if we're somewhere in between?**
**A:** That's normal.

You might be:
- 8 people (too big for Micro-Circle, too small for Baseline Circle)
- 15 people with some economic coordination but no formal structure
- 25 people without Professional Team yet

**Solution:** Use the criteria as guidelines, not rules. Build what serves you.

---

## 🌊 FINAL PRINCIPLE

**Flow is not a destination.**

**It's a direction.**

Micro-Circle, Baseline Circle, Node - these are **snapshots**, not achievements.

**What matters:**
- Are people's Baselines more secure than before?
- Is Calm (L) increasing?
- Is Spontaneity (S) returning?
- Is Interconnection (I) deepening?

If yes: **You're doing Flow.**

Regardless of what you call yourself.

**STATUS:** Active Definition  
**REVIEW:** Update based on real pilot experiences  
**COMMITMENT:** Clear language over academic precision
