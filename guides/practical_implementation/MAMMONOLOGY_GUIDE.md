Practical Guidance for Navigating Away from Mammon Systems

This guide provides actionable steps for individuals seeking to transition from debt-based, coercive systems into the sovereignty and Flow outlined in the Manifesto.


---

1. Identify Friction Points

Recognize where old systems create barriers to Flow.

Debt Mechanisms: Loans, obligations, interest accruals, conditional access.

Dependency Loops: Obligations that force compliance to survive.

Exclusionary Systems: Access control based on wealth, status, or identity.

Fragmentation: Systems designed to create isolation or competition among individuals.


Action: Map your personal or organizational exposure to these friction points.


---

2. Secure Your Baseline

Ensure that your fundamental needs are protected, as defined in MANIFESTO.md.

Checklist: Food, clothes, healthcare, medicine, housing, internet.

Redundancy: Ensure access is not dependent on any single provider or system.

Autonomy: No application, behavioral evaluation, or compliance should control your Baseline.


Action: Verify that each element of the Baseline is guaranteed and protected by logistical stability.

3. Preserve Flow

Flow is the natural movement of curiosity, creation, and meaning.

Monitor Friction: Identify moments where Flow is blocked by external or internal conditions.

Immediate Adjustment: Remove obstacles that compromise Flow without waiting for permission or validation.

Self-Actualization: Align daily activities with personal growth and contribution, not survival.


Action: Implement daily practices that reinforce autonomy and creativity.

4. Protect Cognitive Ownership

Your attention and decision-making are your absolute property.

Digital Hygiene: Minimize exposure to systems that extract or monetize attention.

Financial Independence: Avoid obligations that compromise decision-making or autonomy.

Awareness: Regularly assess whether your focus is under external influence.


Action: Create personal boundaries and technological filters to safeguard cognition.

5. Transition Mapping

Gradually move from old structures to a Flow-aligned life.

1. Assess Current Position: Understand your starting point within Mammon-based systems.


2. Prioritize Baseline Security: Guarantee all fundamental needs first.


3. Phase Out Dependency: Reduce engagement with coercive or debt-based systems.


4. Integrate Flow Practices: Align with creative, autonomous, and meaning-driven activities.


5. Evaluate Progress: Periodically review friction, autonomy, and Flow alignment.



Action: Use this map as a living document to guide decisions and measure sovereignty.
