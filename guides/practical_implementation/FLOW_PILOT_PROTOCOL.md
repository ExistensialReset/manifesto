> **Principle:** This protocol is a guide, not law. Adapt freely. Protect Baseline. Respect autonomy. Document and share learnings.

---

## §1. PURPOSE
The protocol provides a structured framework to start a Flow pilot—a human-centered, ethical, non-coercive approach to existential sovereignty. It is designed to:  

- **Secure the Baseline** for all participants.  
- **Reduce economic friction.**  
- **Facilitate cooperative learning** and experimentation.  
- **Capture insights** for replication.

---

## §2. PARTICIPANTS
**Recommended size:** 10–20 people  

**Roles:**  
- **Facilitator:** Rotating responsibility for meetings, not decisions.  
- **Participants:** Active contributors, maintaining own Baseline.  
- **Observers / Mentors:** Optional guidance without leadership.  

**Participation Principle:** Everyone contributes according to capacity; nobody carries the pilot alone.  

---

## §3. PRE-PILOT CHECKLIST
1. Gather 10–20 interested participants.  
2. Ensure legal and financial clarity.  
3. Define explicit goals in writing.  

> **Tip:** Document these goals and share with participants for transparency.

## §4. MONTHLY TRACKING TEMPLATE
**Month:** [X]  
**Participants:** [List]  
**Baseline Security:** [X/Y fully secure]  
**Participation Rate:** [Z% average]  

### Protocols Tested
| Protocol Name | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| [Example]     | Worked well / Needs revision / Failed |

### Qualitative Outcomes ($L \times S \times I$)
| Factor | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Calm (L) | Increased / Stable / Decreased |
| Spontaneity (S) | Increased / Stable / Decreased |
| Empathy (I) | Increased / Stable / Decreased |

### Key Learnings
1. Most important discovery.  
2. Second most important.  

> **Example Fill:** "Calm increased after adopting morning check-ins."

**Communication Tools:**  
- **Messaging:** Signal  
- **Scheduling:** Shared Calendar  
- **Principle:** Use tools people already know. Avoid tech burden.

## §6. MEETING FACILITATION
- Rotate facilitator role every meeting.  
- Facilitator prepares agenda 24h before.  
- **Format (90 min):**  
  - 0:00–0:10 Check-in  
  - 0:10–0:30 Updates  
  - 0:30–1:00 Main discussion  
  - 1:00–1:20 Decisions & action items  
  - 1:20–1:30 Closing  

> **Tip:** Keep meeting notes in shared doc for continuity.

---

## §7. CRISIS PROTOCOLS (Quick Reference)
1. **Physical Safety:** Call 112 immediately for violence or medical emergencies.  
2. **Baseline Failure:** If someone's Baseline collapses (eviction, job loss):
   - **Immediate (24h):** Circle emergency meeting; ensure safety.  
   - **Short-term (1 week):** Create stabilization plan; distribute support load.  
3. **Circle Collapse:** If pilot is failing, call a pause immediately and assess.  

> **Tip:** Keep a printed/emergency copy accessible to all participants.

---

## §8. INTEGRATION WITH FLOW NETWORK
- **Connecting:** Share anonymized documentation and skill exchange.  
- **Contributing Back:** Mentor new pilots and share protocol modifications in `KNOWN_TENSIONS.md`.  

---

## §9. WISDOM FOR PILOT LEADERS
- **You Are Not the Boss:** Don't decide for others; distribute leadership.  
- **Embrace Mess:** Mistakes and conflicts are learning opportunities.  
- **Protect Your Own Baseline:** Say no to extra responsibilities if burning out.

---

## §10. EVALUATION (MONTH 6)
### Individual Reflection
- Did my Baseline feel more secure?  
- Did I experience more Calm?  
- Was the time investment worth it?

### System Reflection
- Did we reduce economic friction?  
- Did we resolve conflicts constructively?  
- Are we better equipped for future cooperation?

## §11. CHECKLIST SUMMARY
| Month | Key Activities |
|-------|----------------|
| 1 | Orientation, Baseline audits, resource mapping |
| 2 | Economic practices, governance clarification |
| 3 | Mid-pilot review, adjustments |

## §12. FINAL STATEMENT
This protocol is a suggestion. Adapt freely. Protect Baseline. Respect autonomy. Document learnings. Share honestly.
