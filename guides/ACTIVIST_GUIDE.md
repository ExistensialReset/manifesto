# BUILDER’S GUIDE: Implementing Flow

**Don’t protest the old system.  
Build the replacement until the old one becomes irrelevant.**

This guide is practical. It assumes no permission, no ideology, and no central authority.  
Only logistics, collaboration, and Flow.

## Phase 1: The Baseline Circle (10–50 People)

Secure the fundamentals through logistical solidarity — not financial debt.

- **Map Resources**  
  Inventory skills, space, tools, time, and access within your group.

- **Identify Leakage**  
  Locate exactly where energy is drained by Mammon:
  rent, interest, subscriptions, stress, isolation.

- **Pool Logistics**  
  Share what reduces dependency:
  tool libraries, shared spaces, community internet, food access.

The goal of Phase 1 is not comfort —  
it is *existential safety*.

## Phase 2: Production Nodes

Move from *sharing* to *creating*.

- **Garden Nodes**  
  Direct, local nutrition.  
  No price tags. No intermediaries.

- **Maker Nodes**  
  Repair, maintain, and build for longevity.  
  Resist planned obsolescence by design.

- **Energy Nodes**  
  Localize power production to secure the Baseline independently.

Each node reduces exposure to debt-based systems.

## Phase 3: Network Effects

Connect your Circle to others.

When enough Baseline Circles overlap, the debt-system loses leverage.
This is not revolution — it is **Logistical Gravitation**.

The old system collapses not because it is attacked,
but because it becomes unnecessary.

### AXIOM CHECK

- No coercion  
- No leaders  
- No conditional access  

Only Flow.

If the structure violates an axiom,  
the structure must change — not the people.
