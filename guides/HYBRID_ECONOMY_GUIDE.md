**Status:** ACTIVE
**Core Principle:** Use Mammon as a tool, never as a master.

## PREAMBLE
The transition to Flow requires navigating the existing economic reality. This is the bridge—a pragmatic guide to Mammonology.

## §1. THE MAMMON-DEPENDENCY-SCORE (MBS)
The MBS is the percentage of your Baseline (housing, food, energy) that requires fiat currency. 
* **Calculation:** (Mammon-reliant Costs / Total Baseline Value) × 100.
* **Target:** Systematic reduction of MBS toward 0%.

## §2. STRATEGIES FOR LIBERATION
* **Audit:** Eliminate "Mammon-leakage" (subscriptions, high-interest debt).
* **Shared Infrastructure:** Use the Circle to pool vehicles, tools, and land.
* **Flow-Aligned Income:** Monetize surplus (energy, crafts, teaching) only to fund the transition.
* **Legal Hacking:** Utilize non-profits and community-land trusts to shield assets from speculation.

## §3. PSYCHOLOGICAL LUGN
Hybrid living is not hypocrisy; it is tactical survival. Perform "Mammon-detox" rituals after interacting with the old system to maintain your L-value.
