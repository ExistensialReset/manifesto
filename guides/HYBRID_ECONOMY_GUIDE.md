## 🌉 PREAMBLE
Transition to Flow requires navigating existing economic reality.  
This is your **pragmatic bridge** — mastering Mammon without being mastered.

## §1. THE MAMMON-DEPENDENCY-SCORE (MBS) 💳
**Definition:** % of your Baseline that depends on fiat currency.

**Formula:**  
(Mammon-reliant Costs / Total Baseline Value) × 100

**Target:** Progressive reduction of MBS → 0%

**Example:**  
| Resource | Cost | Mammon? | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Housing | $500 | ✅ | Rent for shared apartment |
| Energy | $100 | ✅ | Electricity |
| Food | $200 | ❌ | Community garden & donations |
| Total | $800 | 50% MBS |  |

## §2. STRATEGIES FOR LIBERATION ✨

- **Audit:** Eliminate subscriptions, high-interest debt, hidden fees 🕵️  
- **Shared Infrastructure:** Pool vehicles, tools, land, kitchens 🏠🚜  
- **Flow-Aligned Income:** Monetize surplus only for transition funding 🎨⚡  
- **Legal Hacking:** Non-profits, community-land trusts, cooperatives 🏛️  

> **Tip:** Always ask: "Does this expand Baseline or just my bank account?"

## §3. PSYCHOLOGICAL LUGN 🧘‍♀️

Hybrid living = tactical survival, not hypocrisy.  

- Perform "Mammon-detox" rituals after transactions 💨  
- Reflect on L × S × I impact: did this transaction add or drain Flow?  
- Rotate responsibilities to prevent burnout 🌀

## §4. OPTIONAL: PROGRESSION DASHBOARD 📊

| Month | Target MBS | Actual MBS | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 80% | 82% | Audit completed |
| 2 | 60% | 65% | Pooling starts |
| 3 | 40% | 42% | Flow-aligned income begins |
