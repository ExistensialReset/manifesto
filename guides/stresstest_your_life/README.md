# Stress-Test Your Life: Daily Reflection & Flow Scripts

This guide contains four simple Python scripts inspired by the **Existential Reset Manifesto** and its system of Baseline, Flow ($L \times S \times I$), and $\Sigma$. They are designed for everyday use, helping you reflect on calm, spontaneity, resilience, and systemic parasitic losses without forcing mechanical optimization.

These scripts are suitable for anyone who wants to measure or visualize their personal “flow” in everyday life and understand how human systems interact with resources, both internal and external.

## Scripts Overview

### 1. `daily_calm.py` – Measure Daily Calm ($L$)
* **Purpose:** Track moments of calm in your day, such as meditation, a short walk, or resting.
* **Inspired by:** `DIVINE.md` L-variable and the Baseline principle.
* **What it does:** Prompts you to log minutes spent in calm activities and provides reflection notes based on manifesto principles.

### 2. `spontaneous_connections.py` – Track Spontaneous Connections ($S \times I$)
* **Purpose:** Capture unexpected moments of creativity, insight, or empathetic connection.
* **Inspired by:** $\Sigma$ and cultural sustainability principles.
* **What it does:** Lists entries for the day and adds reflection about the intersection of Spontaneity and Interconnectedness.

### 3. `everyday_resilience.py` – Log Everyday Resilience ($R$)
* **Purpose:** Track how you adapt to small daily challenges.
* **Inspired by:** `SYSTEMIC-RESILIENCE.md` and the Dynamic Human Baseline.
* **What it does:** Allows self-assessment of resilience (1–10) and offers reflection notes inspired by the damped oscillator model ($\zeta=1.25$).

### 4. `MAMMON_DRAIN_CALC.py` – Visualize Parasitic Losses
* **Purpose:** Model and visualize systemic "Mammon-drain"—the parasitic losses in human systems—and how much can be recovered in Flow.
* **Inspired by:** `TECHNICAL_ANNEX.md`: Parasitic Loss Recovery.
* **What it does:** Calculates losses in sectors like Marketing and Planned Obsolescence. Generates a visual bar chart (PNG) and a JSON config for web integration.

## Getting Started

1.  **Install Python 3.x** on your computer.
2.  **Install required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```
3.  **Navigate to this folder** and run any script:
    ```bash
    python daily_calm.py
    ```

## Mindful Usage Tips
* **Observation, not Judgment:** These tools are for reflection. If a day has low "calm," observe it with curiosity rather than self-criticism.
* **Let $\Sigma$ Guide You:** Keep entries honest and natural. The immeasurable flow is often found in the gaps between the data points.
* **Evening Reflection:** We recommend running the first three scripts at the end of your day as a way to "close the loop."
