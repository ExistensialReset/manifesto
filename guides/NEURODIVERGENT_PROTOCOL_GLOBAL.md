## INTRODUCTION: GLOBAL NEURODIVERSITY IS NOT A DEFICIT

### The Node
In this document, we use the term **Node**.

Every neurodivergent person is a unique, valuable point in a global network — a nervous system, a society, a community.  
A node receives and sends signals, connects across cultures, and holds strength in authenticity and lived experience.

**We are all nodes in the network.**

### Mammon Systems (Global Expression)
Extractive systems pathologize difference to maximize productivity, but this appears differently worldwide:

- **Western contexts:** “You can’t sit still for 8 hours? You’re broken.”  
- **East Asian contexts:** “You disrupt group harmony.”  
- **Global South contexts:** “You can’t work consistently? You’re lazy.”

### Flow Response
**No.** The environment adapts to the node.  
Neurodivergence is a natural variation in human cognition — not a disease.

Includes ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and more, often overlapping with trauma or chronic illness.

**Purpose:** To create culturally adaptive environments where all nodes can thrive.

## §0.5 NEURODIVERGENCE AS EXISTENTIAL SOVEREIGNTY IMPLEMENTATION 🌀

Neurodivergence is not a bug in the Mammon system.  
It is a **feature of the Flow system**.

### Life Quality Equation (Flow Mathematics)

$$Life = L \times S \times I$$

Where, for neurodivergent nodes:

- **L (Calm/Lugn):** Baseline guarantee + sensory safety + cultural acceptance  
- **S (Spontaneity):** Authentic expression − masking effort − cultural conformity pressure  
- **I (Innate Empathy/Inkännande):** Reciprocity and mutual regulation within Flow Circles  

### You Are Implementing Global Existential Sovereignty When You:

1. Claim your **Baseline** as non-negotiable (food, housing, care), regardless of cultural pressure.  
2. Build your **Flow Core** (3–7 people who understand your nervous system).  
3. Identify and reduce your **Cultural Mammon Friction Score**.  
4. Use decision trees and external scaffolding during executive dysfunction.  
5. Treat special interests as sovereignty acts — reclaiming attention from extractive systems.  

### Cultural Intelligence in Neurodivergent Support

| Region / Context | Common Challenges | Flow Adaptation |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Western** | Over-pathologization | Environmental adaptation |
| **East Asian** | Conformity pressure | Safe authenticity within harmony |
| **Global South** | Resource scarcity | Community-based support |
| **Indigenous** | Different frameworks | Integrate traditional knowledge |

## §1. ADHD ACROSS CULTURES

### 1.1 ADHD in Global Context
- Hyperactivity recognized more in Western cultures.  
- Inattentive ADHD often misunderstood elsewhere.  
- Frequently moralized or spiritualized.  

**Flow Response:** Structure work around interest, allow movement, enable body doubling.

### 1.2 Culturally Adapted Practices
- Flexible time perception.  
- Movement adapted to cultural norms.  
- Communication style adjusted (direct vs indirect).  
- Family involvement where culturally relevant.  

### 1.3 Medication
- Optional.  
- Never mandatory.  
- Most effective when paired with environmental support.  

---

## §2. AUTISM SPECTRUM WORLDWIDE

### 2.1 Cultural Understandings
- Medical deficit model (West).  
- Family responsibility (East Asia).  
- Spiritual interpretations (Global South).  
- “Different way of being” (Indigenous).

### 2.2 Flow Practices
- Sensory adaptation.  
- Clear communication.  
- Reduced masking.  
- Respect for routines.  

### 2.3 Special Interests
Special interests function as:
- Cultural preservation.  
- Innovation engines.  
- Bridges between communities.  

### 2.4 Masking & Burnout
Masking + cultural conformity = double load.  
Flow creates spaces for **multiple authenticities**.

---

## §3. TRAUMA (PTSD / C-PTSD): GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES

### 3.1 Cultural Trauma
- Individual trauma.  
- Collective trauma.  
- Intergenerational trauma.  
- Displacement trauma.  

### 3.2 Trauma-Informed Flow
- Safety before productivity.  
- Consent over disclosure.  
- Regulation over explanation.  

### 3.3 Trauma Responses
Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn — all valid nervous system strategies.

---

## §4. CHRONIC ILLNESS & DISABILITY WORLDWIDE

### 4.1 Models of Disability
- Medical.  
- Social.  
- Cultural.  
- Spiritual.  

Flow integrates models while centering lived experience.

### 4.2 Energy-Based Participation
- Spoon Theory adapted to economic context.  
- Async participation.  
- Rest as a right.  

---

## §5. OTHER NEURODIVERGENT CONDITIONS

### 5.1 Dyslexia
Language-specific challenges. Flow supports multimodal input/output.

### 5.2 OCD
Culturally shaped obsessions. Flow provides structure without coercion.

### 5.3 Cultural Expressions
Some experiences are unnamed but still valid.

- Assuming universality.  
- Over-medicalization.  

---

## §9. PRINCIPLE: ADAPTATION, NOT ASSIMILATION

**Motto:** > “Your culture is not your enemy. Oppressive systems are.”

1. Identify cultural context.  
2. Secure baseline with dignity.  
3. Balance global knowledge and local support.  
4. Practice cultural authenticity.  

**Welcome to the Global Flow Network.**

---

## GLOBAL PRINCIPLES DECLARATION

1. Neurodiversity is universal, culturally expressed.  
2. No single model fits all.  
3. Center marginalized voices.  
4. Decolonize neurodiversity knowledge.  
5. Practice global solidarity with local adaptation.
