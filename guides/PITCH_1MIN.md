## ⚖️ The Reality Breach

Today, humanity produces enough food for **10.2 billion people**, while we are only **8.2 billion**.  
Yet millions go hungry every day.  

**Why?** Because we allow an outdated system of **artificial scarcity** to override physical reality.  

We are paying a **“Mammon Cost” of 25.5%** in lost human energy — money, marketing, debt management — that produces **zero life value**.

> Note: This is not taxation in general. Taxation funds collective infrastructure; the Mammon Cost is profit extraction with no life benefit.

## 🧬 The Formula: Life = L × S × I

When survival becomes a **privilege you must earn**, your brain stays in survival mode.  
Creativity shrinks. Health deteriorates. Potential is blocked.  

**The Reset secures the Baseline as a birthright:**

- **Infrastructure:** Food, Water, Housing, Clothing  
- **Connectivity:** Healthcare, Medicine, Internet  

This is **not charity**.  
This is **Logistic Physics**. Securing the floor unlocks the ceiling.

## 🌊 What Changes?

When you stop struggling just to exist, you enter **Flow**:

- **From Fear to Calm (L):**  
  Your nervous system recovers. Stress-related illness — which costs billions — decreases.  

- **From Compulsion to Spontaneity (S):**  
  You contribute through curiosity. “Bullshit jobs” are replaced by high-impact action.  

- **From Isolation to Involvement (I):**  
  You reconnect with other Nodes. Collaboration is frictionless because it is **not forced**.  

> The Mammon Cost disappears from your energy ledger.  
> Life becomes measurable by **lived quality, not forced output**.
