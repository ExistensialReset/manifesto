# 🌍 Environmental Gains from Realistic System Improvements

This document presents **evidence-based estimates** of how implementing scientifically supported environmental measures could reduce humanity's ecological footprint. These figures are grounded in real-world data from FAO, IMF, IEA, and peer-reviewed research, rather than theoretical or manifesto-based models.

## Verified Environmental Impacts of the Current System

**Food Waste** – FAO (2022): ~30% of all produced food is lost or wasted (13.2% in the supply chain, 17% at consumer/retail level). This represents a major resource and climate burden.

**Fossil Fuel Subsidies** – IMF (2023): $7 trillion in global subsidies (direct + indirect). These subsidies slow the transition to renewable energy and perpetuate carbon-intensive infrastructure.

**Planned Obsolescence** – EU Parliament (2020): Confirmed as a widespread phenomenon. While reuse and recycling help, the total energy saved is often smaller than expected, contributing to resource depletion and growing waste streams, particularly in electronics.

**Renewable Energy Potential** – IRENA (2023): Technical potential for solar and wind far exceeds global demand. IEA (2023): Renewable energy is now often the cheapest option for electricity generation. The primary barriers are political, financial, and infrastructural, not technical.

## Realistic Potential for Improvement (Based on Research)

**Halving Food Waste** – Achievable reduction of ~8–10% of agriculture’s total climate footprint (WRI, 2019). Can be done with better logistics, storage, policy, and consumer awareness. Possible within current systems.

**Eliminating Fossil Fuel Subsidies** – Could reduce global CO2 emissions by ~28% and prevent millions of premature deaths from air pollution (IMF, 2021). Highly effective policy lever, requiring political will.

**Addressing Planned Obsolescence** – Significant reductions in waste and raw material extraction. Exact global figures are hard to quantify, but electronics waste—the fastest-growing stream—has enormous potential. Requires legislation (e.g., “Right to Repair”) and cultural change.

**Scaling Up Renewables** – ~75–90% of electricity could come from solar/wind by 2050 at low cost (IEA Net Zero Scenario). Requires massive grid, storage, and infrastructure investments. Technically feasible but politically and logistically complex.

## Science vs. Manifesto Claims

- **Where the manifesto is accurate:** Problem scale (30% food waste, $7T subsidies) aligns well with official data. The idea that technical resources exist for a sustainable society is supported by research.  
- **Where the manifesto overestimates:** Its upper-bound gains (25–70% reductions) assume perfect, frictionless global implementation. Real-world change is slower and complex. Achieving a 70% reduction in agriculture's environmental impact would also require a global shift to plant-based diets and revolutionary farming methods—decades-long efforts.

## Potential Gains for Earth

If the world aggressively implemented scientifically backed measures within a **reformed market framework**, potential gains over 20–30 years include:

1. **Climate:** ~30% lower global CO2 emissions, mainly from phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies.  
2. **Resources:** ~20–30% less waste from reduced food waste and planned obsolescence.  
3. **Economy:** $7 trillion/year freed from fossil subsidies for investment in health, education, and green infrastructure.

**Conclusion:** Maximum environmental impact comes from tackling verifiable inefficiencies (food waste, subsidies) rather than implementing a fully new global system. The manifesto provides inspiration, but real data from FAO, IMF, and IEA show measurable gains.
