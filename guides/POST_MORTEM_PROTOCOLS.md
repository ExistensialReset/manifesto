# POST_MORTEM_PROTOCOLS.md

**Status:** ACTIVE LEARNING FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** To treat system endings as sources of intelligence, not shame  
**Core Principle:** Every collapse is data. Every ending is a seed.

## §1. PHILOSOPHY OF ENDING

**Mammon logic says:**  
Failure is weakness. Hide it. Blame someone. Move on without memory.

**Flow logic says:**  
Failure is information. Document it. Learn from it. Carry it forward.

**Foundational truth:**  
Most Circles will eventually end. Not because the people are flawed, but because reality is complex, conditions change, and humans are fragile.

A Circle that ends is not evidence of bad intent or incompetence.  
It is evidence that the system encountered reality.

The responsibility of Flow is not to prevent all collapse —  
but to **remember well enough** that the next Circle does not repeat the same ending blindly.

---

## §2. TRIGGER & AUTHORITY

**Trigger condition:**  
When a Circle can no longer meet its minimum coordination or trust commitments, the Post-Mortem Protocols may be invoked.

**Authority:**  
Any member of the Circle may invoke the protocol.  
No leader approval is required.

This prevents:
- silent collapse
- blame avoidance
- disappearance of responsibility through hierarchy

## §3. THE POST-MORTEM PROCESS

### Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization

**Priority:** Protect human dignity.

**Actions:**
- Ensure all remaining members retain access to their Baseline (food, housing, safety).
- Pause all decision-making related to fault, responsibility, or analysis.

**Rule:**  
No blame. No diagnosis. No lessons yet.  
Safety precedes understanding.

---

### Phase 2: Individual Reflection

Each member documents their experience privately.

Suggested prompts:
- What originally brought you into this Circle?
- When did you first sense a shift or strain?
- What do you believe you contributed — positively or negatively?
- What did this experience teach you about yourself, others, or the system?

These reflections are owned by the individual.  
Sharing is voluntary.

---

### Phase 3: Collective Witnessing

**Purpose:** To be heard without defense.

**Structure:**
- One speaker at a time.
- No interruptions.
- No corrections.
- No debate.
- No requirement for response.

This is not conflict resolution.  
It is witnessing.

Listening is an act of system repair, even when the Circle itself ends.

---

### Phase 4: Pattern Analysis

Only after safety and witnessing are complete.

Focus areas:
- **Structural patterns** (roles, incentives, coordination load)
- **Interpersonal patterns** (communication breakdowns, trust erosion)
- **Resource patterns** (time scarcity, energy drain, external pressure)

The goal is not to assign fault, but to identify **repeatable tensions**.

---

### Phase 5: Documentation & Memory

Outcomes are documented as an anonymized case study.

Requirements:
- No names
- No identifying details
- Focus on patterns, not personalities

The case study is added to the shared Flow archive:
`KNOWN_TENSIONS.md`

This transforms individual collapse into collective intelligence.

---

## §4. FEEDBACK INTO FUTURE DESIGN

All Post-Mortem insights must be reviewed by future Circle initiators during formation.

A Circle may not be formed without acknowledging:
- which known tensions apply
- what safeguards are being attempted
- what risks remain unresolved

Memory is a system responsibility.

---

## §5. FINAL PRINCIPLE

A Circle that ends is not a Circle that failed.

It existed.  
People were held.  
Truth was spoken.  
Knowledge was generated.

In Flow, endings are not erased.

They are carried forward.
