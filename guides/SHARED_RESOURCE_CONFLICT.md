# SHARED_RESOURCE_CONFLICT.md

**Status:** ACTIVE MEDIATION FRAMEWORK  
**Purpose:** Navigate conflicts over non-divisible resources  
**Principle:** Scarcity is real. Coercion is not the answer.

## §0. DECISIONAL ETHOS (L × S × I)

All mediation under this protocol is guided by the triad:

**L × S × I = Lugn × Spontanitet × Inkännande**

This is not a formula to optimize outcomes.  
It is a **human readiness filter**.

If calm cannot be maintained, decisions are paused.  
If spontaneity is suppressed, solutions stagnate.  
If empathy is absent, legitimacy dissolves.

No resolution reached in panic is considered valid.

## §1. RESOLUTION LEVELS

Conflicts over shared or non-divisible resources are approached gradually, never forcefully.

### 1. Joint Exploration
Participants explore together:
- Can the resource be shared?
- Can usage be staggered?
- Can a substitute be found?

The aim is not efficiency, but mutual understanding.

---

### 2. Logistical Simulation
Neutral parties (human or AI-assisted) model the consequences of different options.

Simulations are **informational**, not prescriptive.  
They exist to reduce fear, not to dictate outcomes.

---

### 3. Regional Mediation
External Circles may offer **non-binding recommendations**, grounded in L × S × I.

Their role is to lend perspective, not authority.  
Listening is expected. Compliance is not forced.

---

### 4. Structured Coexistence
When agreement cannot be reached, coexistence replaces resolution.

Possible forms include:
- Lottery
- Temporal division (e.g., alternating years or seasons)
- Shared stewardship with clearly bounded use

Choosing to live with tension is preferable to resolving it through domination.

## §2. THE WATER AXIOM

Baseline access to water for drinking, sanitation, and basic life maintenance is **non-negotiable**.

No Circle may compete for, restrict, or weaponize access to life-sustaining water.

Water is not a shared resource in conflict.  
It is a condition for participation in any system at all.

---

## §3. CLOSING NOTE

This protocol does not promise harmony.  
It promises restraint.

When scarcity appears, the measure of a system is not how fast it decides —  
but how human it remains while deciding.
