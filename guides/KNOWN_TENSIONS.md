# KNOWN_TENSIONS.md

**Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT (v1.0)  
**Purpose:** To acknowledge unresolved design tensions in Flow architecture  
**Principle:** Tensions are not failures - they are maps of where reality will test us

---

## PREAMBLE: WHY THIS DOCUMENT EXISTS

Flow is not dogma. It is a living system that will encounter friction between its principles and lived reality.

**This document exists because:**
1. Honest design acknowledges its limits
2. Tensions reveal where iteration is needed
3. Pretending coherence where none exists creates brittle systems
4. Living systems grow through their contradictions

**How to use this:**
- Implementers: Know these tensions before you encounter them
- Critics: These are our known vulnerabilities - help us address them
- Future architects: Update this as new tensions emerge

## TENSIONS

### 1. SRS & THE LUXURY/BASELINE BOUNDARY
- **Design:** Baseline is unconditional; Luxury allocated via SRS  
- **Tension:** When luxury is necessary for Flow, low-SRS nodes can’t access essential tools  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Baseline+Tier, Request Without Score, Apprentice Bypass

### 2. REFUGIUM DURATION & PERMANENT REST
- **Design:** Temporary rest allowed up to 12 months  
- **Tension:** Unlimited rest may cascade into overload for remaining nodes  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Chronic Rest as State, Refugium Census, Graduated Re-emergence

### 3. THE SILENT COLONY - WHO DECIDES?
- **Design:** Isolate nodes choosing Mammon-logic  
- **Tension:** Determining what counts as Mammon is ambiguous  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Resonance Pause, Self-Selection, Time-Boxed Review

### 4. AI AS "RESTING INFRASTRUCTURE" VS. CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE
- **Design:** AI supports without coercion  
- **Tension:** How to keep AI “at rest” while monitoring?  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Separate AI Roles, AI-Fast Mandatory, Adversarial AI

### 5. CONFLICT "COEXISTENCE" & SLOW POISONING
- **Design:** Allow unresolved conflicts under Coexistence Protocol  
- **Tension:** Conflicts can compound over years  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Sunset Clause, Third-Party Resource Mediation, Baseline Protection Override

### 6. EMPATHY (I) AT SCALE - THE DUNBAR WALL
- **Design:** Small primary sub-circles; fractal larger network  
- **Tension:** Empathy for distant nodes is limited  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Pilgrimage Protocol, Kinship Lottery, Crisis Visibility

### 7. TRANSITION & THE MAMMON INTERFACE
- **Design:** Transition protocol from Mammon to Flow  
- **Tension:** Interaction between Flow and Mammon worlds is undefined  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Open Baseline, Transition Bridges, Capacity-Based Openness

### 8. CHILDREN'S SOVEREIGNTY VS. PARENTAL PROTECTION
- **Design:** Children gain agency gradually  
- **Tension:** Conflicts between child choice and parent protection  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Graduated Sovereignty, Circle as Third Voice, Reversibility Principle

### 9. GLOBAL EXPANSION VS. CULTURAL IMPERIALISM
- **Design:** Universal axioms, local protocols  
- **Tension:** Flow may conflict with cultural norms  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Fork-Friendly Architecture, Cultural Audits, Post-Colonial Safeguard

### 10. DEATH OF THE ARCHITECT
- **Design:** Flow meant to be leaderless  
- **Tension:** What happens when Elinor steps away?  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Architect Emeritus Protocol, Living Document Culture, Suicide Clause

---

## META-TENSION: THE DOCUMENT ITSELF
- **Tension:** Transparency may undermine confidence  
- **Approach:** Radical honesty, trust implementers to engage thoughtfully

---

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
- **Implementers:** Read before starting  
- **Critics:** Highlight vulnerabilities or offer solutions  
- **Iterators:** Fork, update, version, document learnings

---

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE
**A system is only as strong as its ability to acknowledge weakness.**  
Tensions are not bugs, they are the frontier where theory meets reality.

**STATUS:** Living Document (Update on encounter)  
**VALIDATION:** Honest Systems Design  
**COMMITMENT:** We will not pretend to have answers we don't have

**Last updated:** January 2026  
**Next review:** When first major tension is encountered in practice
