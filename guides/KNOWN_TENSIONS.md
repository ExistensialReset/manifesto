# KNOWN_TENSIONS.md

**Status:** LIVING DOCUMENT (v1.1)  
**Purpose:** To acknowledge unresolved design tensions in Flow architecture  
**Principle:** Tensions are not failures - they are maps of where reality will test us

---

## PREAMBLE: WHY THIS DOCUMENT EXISTS

Flow is not dogma. It is a living system that will encounter friction between its principles and lived reality.

**This document exists because:**
1. Honest design acknowledges its limits
2. Tensions reveal where iteration is needed
3. Pretending coherence where none exists creates brittle systems
4. Living systems grow through their contradictions
5. Awareness of tension **prevents accidental Mammonization**
6. Transparency and documentation within circles can create both clarity and friction

**How to use this:**
- **Implementers:** Know these tensions before you encounter them
- **Critics:** These are our known vulnerabilities - help us address them
- **Future architects:** Update this as new tensions emerge
- **Circle leaders:** Treat as a living map, not a rulebook

## TENSIONS

### 1. SRS & THE LUXURY/BASELINE BOUNDARY
- **Design:** Baseline is unconditional; Luxury allocated via SRS  
- **Tension:** When luxury is necessary for Flow, low-SRS nodes can’t access essential tools  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Baseline+Tier, Request Without Score, Apprentice Bypass  
- **Notes:** Always check if the resource can become Baseline before invoking SRS.

### 2. REFUGIUM DURATION & PERMANENT REST
- **Design:** Temporary rest allowed up to 12 months  
- **Tension:** Unlimited rest may cascade into overload for remaining nodes  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Chronic Rest as State, Refugium Census, Graduated Re-emergence  
- **Notes:** Balance rest cycles; track impact on active node capacity.

### 3. THE SILENT COLONY - WHO DECIDES?
- **Design:** Isolate nodes choosing Mammon-logic  
- **Tension:** Determining what counts as Mammon is ambiguous  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Resonance Pause, Self-Selection, Time-Boxed Review  
- **Notes:** Decisions should **never override Baseline**.

### 4. AI AS "RESTING INFRASTRUCTURE" VS. CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE
- **Design:** AI supports without coercion  
- **Tension:** How to keep AI “at rest” while monitoring?  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Separate AI Roles, AI-Fast Mandatory, Adversarial AI  
- **Notes:** Humans retain final judgment; AI is advisory, not directive.

### 5. CONFLICT "COEXISTENCE" & SLOW POISONING
- **Design:** Allow unresolved conflicts under Coexistence Protocol  
- **Tension:** Conflicts can compound over years  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Sunset Clause, Third-Party Resource Mediation, Baseline Protection Override  
- **Notes:** Track unresolved conflicts and triggers for escalation.

### 6. EMPATHY (I) AT SCALE - THE DUNBAR WALL
- **Design:** Small primary sub-circles; fractal larger network  
- **Tension:** Empathy for distant nodes is limited  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Pilgrimage Protocol, Kinship Lottery, Crisis Visibility  
- **Notes:** Use sub-circles to distribute relational load.

### 7. TRANSITION & THE MAMMON INTERFACE
- **Design:** Transition protocol from Mammon to Flow  
- **Tension:** Interaction between Flow and Mammon worlds is undefined  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Open Baseline, Transition Bridges, Capacity-Based Openness  
- **Notes:** Define clear interaction principles; avoid coercion or exploitation.

### 8. CHILDREN'S SOVEREIGNTY VS. PARENTAL PROTECTION
- **Design:** Children gain agency gradually  
- **Tension:** Conflicts between child choice and parent protection  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Graduated Sovereignty, Circle as Third Voice, Reversibility Principle  
- **Notes:** Document outcomes to inform future protocols.

### 9. GLOBAL EXPANSION VS. CULTURAL IMPERIALISM
- **Design:** Universal axioms, local protocols  
- **Tension:** Flow may conflict with cultural norms  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Fork-Friendly Architecture, Cultural Audits, Post-Colonial Safeguard  
- **Notes:** Encourage local translation; prioritize empathy and Inkännande.

### 10. DEATH OF THE ARCHITECT
- **Design:** Flow meant to be leaderless  
- **Tension:** What happens when Elinor steps away?  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Architect Emeritus Protocol, Living Document Culture, Suicide Clause  
- **Notes:** Leadership is decentralized; all nodes must be prepared to self-organize.

### 11. CIRCLE OPENNESS VS. PRIVATE SAFETY
- **Design:** Flow Circles emphasize transparency, documentation, and shared learning  
- **Tension:** Full openness can expose nodes to judgment, Mammon co-option, or privacy loss  
- **Iterative Solutions:** Tiered Documentation, In-Circle Vetting, Shadow Notes, Optional Openness  
- **Notes:** Balance transparency with consent; document decisions about disclosure protocols.

## META-TENSION: THE DOCUMENT ITSELF
- **Tension:** Transparency may undermine confidence  
- **Approach:** Radical honesty, trust implementers to engage thoughtfully  
- **Notes:** Document evolution; version control is critical.

---

## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
- **Implementers:** Read before starting  
- **Critics:** Highlight vulnerabilities or offer solutions  
- **Iterators:** Fork, update, version, document learnings  
- **Circle Leaders:** Conduct regular tension audits and share insights

---

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE
**A system is only as strong as its ability to acknowledge weakness.**  
Tensions are not bugs, they are the frontier where theory meets reality.  
**Iteration is sacred. Transparency is your ally. Reflection is your tool.**

**STATUS:** Living Document (Update on encounter)  
**VALIDATION:** Honest Systems Design  
**COMMITMENT:** We will not pretend to have answers we don't have.  

**Last updated:** January 2026  
**Next review:** Upon encountering first major tension in practice.
