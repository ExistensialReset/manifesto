#Building Flow: A Practical Guide for Organizers

You don't need to wait for a global revolution. Flow starts locally and spreads through logistical gravitation.

## Level 1: Form a Baseline Circle (10-50 People)
Create a mutual aid network that guarantees the fundamental needs of its members.
* **Map Resources:** Don't look at bank accounts. Map skills, space, tools, and food access.
* **Identify Friction:** Where is the group losing energy to Mammon? (Rent, high interest, isolation).
* **Shared Logistics:** Start pooling—one shared meal a day, a tool library, or a shared community internet mesh.

## Level 2: Local Production Nodes
Move from "sharing what we bought" to "creating what we need."
* **Community Gardens:** Direct distribution to the Circle, excess to the Critical Reserve.
* **Maker Spaces:** Focus on repair and longevity to fight planned obsolescence.
* **Energy Cooperatives:** Shared solar/wind setups to power the Baseline.

## Level 3: Debt Resistance
Isolation is Mammon's weapon. Resistance is a team sport.
* **Collective Bargaining:** Negotiate medical or student debt as a block.
* **The Rolling Jubilee:** Use pooled resources to buy and nullify distressed debt.

## Core Principles for Organizers
1.  **Non-Coercion:** Participation must be voluntary.
2.  **No Hierarchy:** Rotate responsibilities. No permanent leaders.
3.  **Transparency:** Keep a visible ledger of *flows* (needs and contributions), not *debts*.

**Don't protest the old system. Build the replacement until the old one becomes irrelevant.**
