# BUILDER’S GUIDE: Implementing Flow

**Don't protest the old system. Build the replacement until the old one becomes irrelevant.**

### Phase 1: The Baseline Circle (10-50 People)
Secure the fundamentals through logistical solidarity, not financial debt.
* **Map Resources:** Inventory skills, space, and tools within your group.
* **Identify Leakage:** See exactly where your group's energy is being "drained" by Mammon (rent, interest, isolation).
* **Pool Logistics:** Create tool libraries, community internet meshes, and shared food access.

### Phase 2: Production Nodes
Move from *sharing* to *creating*.
* **Garden Nodes:** Direct distribution of nutrition. No price tags.
* **Maker Nodes:** Repair and build for longevity. Fight planned obsolescence.
* **Energy Nodes:** Localize power production to secure the Baseline.

### Phase 3: Network Effects
Connect your node to others. When enough circles overlap, the debt-system loses its grip. This is **Logistical Gravitation**.

**AXIOM CHECK:** No coercion. No leaders. Just Flow.
