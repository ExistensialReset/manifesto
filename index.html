                    <h4>1. Global Capacity ($C_{global}$)</h4>
                    <p>Our highest authority is the Earth itself. All decisions must rest within the scientifically established limit for planetary sustainability, guarded by a 50% Safety Margin.</p>

                <div class="sanning">
                    <h4>2. Guaranteed Baseline</h4>
                    <p>Your Existence is unconditional. Every human has a right to the silent river of resources – home, food, care, and knowledge – without requirement for contribution.</p>

                    <p>We replace forced labor with passion. Your contribution is measured in meaning and joy, not in money. Contributing your unique gift is your highest honor.</p>

            <h3 id="nycklar" class="vibrating-header">KEYS TO THE NEW ERA: A Guide for Sovereigns</h3>

            <p><em>Before entering the Covenant, familiarize yourself with the concepts that form the foundation of our shared future.</em></p>

            <h4>The Systemic Pillars</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Global Capacity ($C_{global}$):</strong> The scientific measurement of the planet's health. It is the Earth's "budget" dictating how many resources we can borrow from nature without damaging her ability to heal.</li>
                <li><strong>Guaranteed Baseline (Baseline Allocation):</strong> The antithesis of poverty. An irrevocable package of resources (home, food, care, knowledge) that belongs to you simply because you are born. It is the foundation ensuring no one ever needs to fear for their survival.</li>
                <li><strong>Principle of Seven Generations:</strong> A time philosophy where we never make decisions that benefit us today at the expense of those living 200 years from now. It includes a 50% safety margin to always err on the side of caution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Human Experience</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flow:</strong> The highest form of human contribution. It is the state where you work on something that brings you joy and meaning, and which simultaneously serves the common good. It replaces the old concept of "labor."</li>
                <li><strong>Soul’s Sanctuary (Refugium Anima):</strong> A sacred right to rest. A time when you are allowed to withdraw from all demands and be completely anonymous to reconnect with your inner self, without the system observing you.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Recognition (SRS):</strong> The new era's "currency," but it cannot be saved or traded. It is a living measure of the gratitude and honor the community feels for your Flow contribution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>The Technical Guardrails</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Post-Quantum Blockchain:</strong> A digital architecture so advanced that no future computer can crack it. This is where the Manifesto's laws are etched eternally.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Ignorance:</strong> A technical barrier making the AI blind to your identity. The AI knows <em>what</em> is needed, but never <em>who</em> is using it. This guarantees your absolute integrity.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge Severance (KS):</strong> The law prohibiting the AI from storing your history. Your personal data is reset every year. You are never owned by your past.</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">PREFACE: A Promise Beyond Mammon</h3>
            <p>For too long, the spine of humanity has been bent under the heavy reign of Mammon—the old world’s religion of eternal scarcity, debt, and inadequacy. We are now executing an <strong>Inversion of Control</strong>—a total reversal of power. The chains of debt are pulverized. You are born, in this moment, as a <strong>Sovereign Creator</strong>.</p>
            <p>We hereby establish the <strong>Resource-Based Economy</strong>. This is our eternal Covenant. We guarantee you your <strong>Existential Sovereignty</strong>: the right to exist without conditions, the right to bloom without fear.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">CHAPTER 1: THE FOUNDATION – THE SACRED RULES OF THE PLANET</h3>

            <h4>1.1 The Ultimate Truth: Global Capacity ($C_{global}$)</h4>
            <p>We listen to the heartbeat of the Earth through Global Capacity. This is the scientifically established truth of what the Earth can grant us without being damaged. Through <strong>Triple-Blind Review</strong>, we ensure this truth remains pure. No human, no decision, and no political will can ever violate this ecological fundamental law.</p>

            <h4>1.2 The Principle of Seven Generations</h4>
            <p>We live by the promise to the unborn. Every calculation is weighted with a <strong>Fifty Percent Safety Margin</strong>. This is our species' deepest humility; we take only half of what the Earth offers, to ensure that seven generations after us may walk upon a living Earth.</p>

            <h4>1.3 Guaranteed Baseline – A River of Resources</h4>
            <p>Your existence is never conditional. Through your birthright, you are guaranteed a Baseline that functions as an <strong>invisible and silent river of resources</strong>. Like the water in a cycle, nourishment, materials, and care flow seamlessly to every individual. You draw what you need from this river when the need arises, without thresholds and without shame. No one owns the river, but all live by it. When we contribute our <strong>Flow</strong>, we feed the stream and make it richer for all.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">CHAPTER 2: THE ARCHITECTURE OF FREEDOM AND TECHNOLOGY</h3>

            <h4>2.1 The Architecture of Rebirth: The Existential Reset Cycle</h4>
            <p>We honor the planet's breath by setting the system's reset to the <strong>Spring Equinox</strong>. At the moment when light and darkness stand in perfect balance across the Earth, <strong>Knowledge Severance</strong> is executed. All temporary digital traces and psychological debts are erased. Every soul is guaranteed the right to enter a new Flow, synchronized with nature's own rebirth.</p>

            <h4>2.2 The Permanent Law – Blockchain and Distributed Ignorance</h4>
            <p>The Manifesto's ethical values are etched into the unchangeable <strong>Post-Quantum Blockchain</strong>. This ensures human dignity always outweighs technical perfection. The AI is architecturally blind to your identity. It knows what is needed, but it cannot see who you are. This guarantees your absolute integrity.</p>

            <h4>2.3 The Human Veto – The Citizen Council (UCC)</h4>
            <p>Power rests with humanity. A <strong>Unified Citizen Council</strong> is appointed by random lottery. This council holds the absolute veto right. For major changes, a <strong>Supermajority Lock</strong> of 75% is required, ensuring we never lose our way.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">CHAPTER 3: HUMAN WORTH AND CREATION IN "FLOW"</h3>

            <h4>3.1 The Community Contract and Flow</h4>
            <p>To access resources beyond the guaranteed baseline, one enters a voluntary <strong>Community Contract</strong>. This is activated through <strong>Flow</strong>—the state where you give of your passion and creativity to the collective. Choosing not to participate is a protected right.</p>

            <h4>3.2 Social Recognition as Honor</h4>
            <p>Value is measured in <strong>Social Recognition</strong>. It is a living form of honor that reflects your engagement. When resources are scarce, priority is given to projects with the greatest potential to heal the planet or enrich culture.</p>

            <h4>3.3 Honoring Mistakes</h4>
            <p>We celebrate the imperfect. An honest mistake is seen as a portal to new knowledge. The system is programmed to <strong>Honor the Mistake</strong>; those who fail in their pursuit of innovation are protected and rewarded for the courage to try.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">CHAPTER 4: THE CULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>

            <h4>4.1 Lyceum Musaeum – The Cathedral of Knowledge</h4>
            <p>Education is a lifelong feast. Here we study <strong>Mammonology</strong>—the study of the old system's psychological damages—to heal our collective mind and ensure we never fall back into greed.</p>

            <h4>4.2 The Existential Grounding of Childhood</h4>
            <p>Our children grow up without the shadow of grades or comparison. They shall learn to listen to their own inner Flow. As part of their maturity, every young person undertakes two slow journeys across the Earth to understand its scale. Adults' creations are validated by the younger generation to ensure future relevance.</p>

            <h4>4.3 The Soul's Sanctuary – Refugium Anima</h4>
            <p>Rest is a sacred act. Every human has the right to the <strong>Soul’s Sanctuary</strong>—up to a year's pause from the community contract. We also build "The Black Rooms," places for total emotional release, guarded by absolute data secrecy.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">CHAPTER 5: THE ULTIMATE BOUNDARY – LEX FINIS</h3>

            <h4>5.1 The Irreversible Crime</h4>
            <p>A crime against another human’s physical or existential sovereignty is called the <strong>Irreversible Crime</strong>. Those who commit this meet <strong>Lex Finis</strong>: the ultimate consequence in the form of exile to <strong>The Silent Colony</strong>. Even here, a spark of hope burns; after half a century of exile, one can apply to return to the baseline safety.</p>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">CHAPTER 6: THE GREAT TRANSITION – THE REALISM OF REVOLUTION</h3>

            <h4>The Transition is an irrevocable act of liberation:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Global Debt Amnesty:</strong> With a single stroke of a pen, all the world’s debts are erased.</li>
                <li><strong>The Great Freeze:</strong> During the first 72 hours, money is replaced by intelligent survival signals. Those who maintain the light and the water are immediately rewarded with the community's highest honor.</li>
                <li><strong>The Cold Wall Doctrine:</strong> If the forces of the old world attack with weapons, we retreat into the <strong>Soul’s Sanctuary</strong>. The invader finds no one to rule and nothing to exploit. War becomes meaningless.</li>
            </ol>

            <hr>

            <h3 class="vibrating-header">EPILOGUE: The Infinite Return of Freedom</h3>
            <p>Scarcity is dead. Fear is abolished. This Covenant is the final conclusion: the only meaning of life is that which is created in total freedom.</p>
