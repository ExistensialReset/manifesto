Quick Reference for Navigating from Legacy Systems to Flow

This guide provides practical steps for seekers transitioning from debt-based systems to the Baseline and Flow. It complements the clinical map in MAMMONOLOGY.md.


---

I. IDENTIFY FRICTION POINTS

Observe where access to essentials is conditional.

Note where attention, time, or energy is extracted for repayment or compliance.

Document recurring leverage mechanisms or bottlenecks that limit Flow.


II. SECURE THE BASELINE

Ensure consistent access to food, housing, healthcare, medicine, and internet.

Prioritize maintaining the 30% Critical Reserve as personal or collective buffer.

Treat Baseline as a non-negotiable system constant, not a reward.


III. PROTECT SOVEREIGNTY

Recognize your attention, cognition, and agency as absolute property.
