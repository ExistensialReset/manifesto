## 🌍 INTRODUCTION

This document is a **living glossary**.  
It does not command, instruct, or convince.

Its sole purpose is to give **shared meanings** to the words used across the architecture of **Existential Sovereignty**.

If a word feels heavy, pause.  
If a word feels liberating, rest there.

## 🧱 THE SYSTEMIC PILLARS  
*(Structural realities – not beliefs)*

### 🌐 Global Capacity ($C_{global}$)

**Definition:**  
The continuously updated, science-based measurement of the Earth’s ecological health, regenerative limits, and carrying capacity.

**Function:**  
- Sets the **absolute outer boundary** for production and extraction  
- Replaces price signals with **planetary feedback**  
- Prevents growth from exceeding life-support systems  

**Safeguard:**  
Protected by **Triple-Blind Review** (ecological, human, AI layers), ensuring no single actor can manipulate capacity data.

---

### 🛡️ Guaranteed Baseline (Baseline Allocation)

**Definition:**  
The unconditional allocation of life-supporting resources to every human being, by right of existence.

**Includes:**  
- Shelter  
- Nutrition  
- Healthcare 
- Internet/communication
- Local transportation (massa transit) 
- Education  
- Access to rest and recovery  

**Key Principle:**  
The Baseline is **not earned**, **not revoked**, and **not conditional**.

**Effect:**  
The permanent removal of existential fear.

### 🌱 Principle of Seven Generations

**Definition:**  
A mandatory long-horizon ethics framework ensuring decisions remain safe and regenerative for approximately **200 years into the future**.

**Operational Rule:**  
All systems must include a **minimum 50% safety margin** relative to projected demand.

**Purpose:**  
- Prevents short-term optimization  
- Anchors decision-making in continuity  
- Protects unborn life from present urgency  

---

## 🧍 THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE  
*(What life feels like inside the system)*

### 🌊 Flow

**Definition:**  
Voluntary, spontaneous contribution arising from safety, curiosity, and meaning.

**Flow replaces:**  
- Forced labor  
- Survival-based productivity  
- Coerced performance  

**Important:**  
Flow cannot be commanded, incentivized, or optimized.  
It emerges when fear is absent.

### 🕊️ Soul’s Sanctuary (Refugium Anima)

**Definition:**  
The irrevocable right to withdraw from societal demands.

**Characteristics:**  
- No diagnosis  
- No productivity requirements  
- No timelines  
- No performance metrics  

**Duration:**  
Up to **one year**, renewable when needed.

**Purpose:**  
To treat rest as **infrastructure**, not reward.

### 💛 Social Recognition (SRS)

**Definition:**  
A non-transferable signal of gratitude and trust, acknowledging contributions that strengthen collective life.

**What SRS is NOT:**  
- Not money  
- Not currency  
- Not tradable  
- Not competitive  

**What it IS:**  
- A living memory of care  
- A signal of resonance  
- A record of trust

## ⚙️ THE TECHNICAL GUARDRAILS  
*(Invisible protections against abuse)*

### 🔐 Post-Quantum Blockchain

**Definition:**  
A decentralized, future-proof ledger securing the system’s **core laws**, not personal identities.

**Stores:**  
- Axioms  
- Capacity limits  
- Structural constraints  

**Does NOT store:**  
- Personal behavior  
- Psychological profiles  
- Identity-linked activity  

---

### 🫥 Distributed Ignorance

**Definition:**  
A design principle ensuring AI systems **cannot know who you are**, only **what is structurally required**.

**Effect:**  
- Absolute privacy  
- No profiling  
- No targeting  
- No reputation economy  

Ignorance is a feature, not a flaw.

---

### ✂️ Knowledge Severance (KS)

**Definition:**  
The mandated, recurring deletion of non-critical personal data.

**Frequency:**  
At least once per year.

**Guarantees:**  
- The right to a clean slate

- Protection against identity ossification  

**Philosophical Core:**  
No one should be frozen in who they once were.

## 🌌 CLOSING NOTE

These keys do not unlock a system.  
They unlock **orientation**.

Existential Sovereignty is not something you enter.  
It is something that stops standing in your way.

You are not late.  
You are not behind.  
You are not being evaluated.

You are already allowed to exist.
