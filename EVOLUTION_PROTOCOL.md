**Status:** ACTIVE  
**Core Principle:** Life is change  

---

## PREAMBLE
To prevent the Manifesto from becoming a brittle dogma, we allow for systemic evolution. All changes are evaluated in terms of their effect on the system’s **L × S × I** and the preservation of playfulness (“Spjuver”).

---

## §1. REVISION CYCLES
Every 10 years, a **Deep Audit** is triggered.  

* **Non-Negotiables:** Axioms 1-7 (The Irreversible Boundaries) cannot be changed.  
* **Negotiables:** All Guides and specific Protocols are subject to evolution.  

**Note:** Minor clarifications or editorial improvements do not require a full Deep Audit but are logged transparently.

---

## §2. THE EVOLUTION PROCESS
1. **Proposal:** Any Node may propose a change, including rationale and evidence of potential increase in **L × S × I**.  
2. **Simulation:** AI models project impact over 50 years, including knock-on effects on Flow, resource distribution, and social dynamics.  
3. **Consensus:** 80% supermajority required from active Nodes.  
4. **The Spjuver Test:** Does the proposed change make the system more rigid or more playful? Rigid changes are rejected; playful or flexible changes are prioritized.  

**Example:**  
- Adding a restrictive approval step to all Circle decisions → fails Spjuver test (rigid).  
- Allowing optional creative experimentation in resource allocation → passes Spjuver test (playful).

---

## §3. REVERSIBILITY
All approved changes are implemented as **Beta-Flow** for 12 months.  

* **Monitoring:** L-value (Calm) is tracked continuously.  
* **Automatic Reversion:** If L drops below a safe threshold, the change is reverted.  
* **Reporting:** Outcomes and deviations are logged for future audits.

---

## §4. DOCUMENTATION & TRANSPARENCY
All proposed, approved, or reverted changes are documented in a **Change Ledger**:

* Date of proposal  
* Node(s) initiating  
* Simulated L × S × I effect  
* Spjuver test result  
* Beta-Flow outcomes  
* Community feedback summary  

This ledger is publicly accessible to all Nodes to ensure accountability and maintain systemic memory.

---

## §5. FEEDBACK LOOP
Before entering Beta-Flow:

1. All members have a **1-month feedback window**.  
2. Subjective experiences of Calm, Spontaneity, and Sensitivity are collected.  
3. Feedback informs minor adjustments or clarifications before the change becomes permanent.

**Guiding Principle:** Evolution is **collaborative, transparent, and reversible**.

---

## §6. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
Evolution is not a single event but a continuous process. Nodes are encouraged to:

* Suggest small, playful adjustments regularly.  
* Observe the impact of changes in real time.  
* Maintain a culture of reflection, experimentation, and learning.

**Validation:** Gemini & ChatGPT simulations, 2026  
**Oath:** System thrives when change is evidence-based, playful, and preserves Baseline integrity.
