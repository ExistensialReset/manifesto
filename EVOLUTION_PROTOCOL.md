# EVOLUTION_PROTOCOL.md
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Core Principle:** Life is change.

## PREAMBLE
To prevent the Manifesto from becoming a brittle dogma, we allow for systemic evolution.

## §1. REVISION CYCLES
Every 10 years, a "Deep Audit" is triggered. 
* **Non-Negotiables:** Axioms 1-7 (The Irreversible Boundaries) cannot be changed.
* **Negotiables:** All Guides and specific Protocols are subject to evolution.

## §2. THE EVOLUTION PROCESS
1.  **Proposal:** Any Node can propose a change based on evidence of increased L x S x I.
2.  **Simulation:** AI models the change over a 50-year projection.
3.  **Consensus:** 80% supermajority required.
4.  **The Spjuver Test:** Does the change make the system more rigid or more playful? Rigid changes are rejected.

## §3. REVERSIBILITY
All changes are implemented as "Beta-Flow" for 12 months. If the community's L-value (Calm) drops, the change is automatically reverted.
