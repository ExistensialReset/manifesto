# REGIONAL_DEADLOCK_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION  
**Purpose:** Resolve large-scale regional disputes (50+ Nodes)  
**Principle:** Scale changes everything; protect Baseline while mediating

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS
- 50+ Nodes on at least one side involved
- Conflict threatens Baseline for 1,000+ people
- Local mediation and needs mapping exhausted
- Unresolved for 6+ months
- Both regions acknowledge deadlock

## §2. IMMEDIATE BASELINE PROTECTION MEASURES
- Emergency resource distribution
- Temporary sharing agreements (30-90 days)
- Baseline needs met for all parties
- Crisis mode if necessary
- Conflict freeze enforced (no escalation, no unilateral seizure)

## §3. SCALABLE INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL WITH AI ASSISTANCE
- Conflict Mapping Team: 5-7 people from uninvolved regions + AI data analysis
- Minor: remote analysis only
- Medium: AI-assisted + partial in-person verification
- Major: full team, multiple sub-conflicts handled in parallel

## §4. REQUIRED EXPERTISE AND ROLE VERIFICATION
- Mediators, technical experts, environmental specialists
- Access to regional and bioregional networks
- Understanding of L×S×I dynamics and resource baselines
- Use simplified approach if expertise unavailable, document gaps

## §5. RESOLUTION PATHWAYS
- Path A: Technical Solution (30%)
- Path B: Structured Sharing (40%)
- Path C: Parallel Mandates (20%)
- Path D: Bioregional Fork (5%)
- Path E: Escalation to Global Flow Network (5%)

## §6. PROTOCOL PRIORITY MATRIX INTEGRATION
- Baseline Emergency overrides all paths
- Harm to persons takes precedence over resource allocation
- Slow erosion or wellbeing protocols secondary

## §7. METRICS AND FEEDBACK
- Track Baseline security, L×S×I before/after
- Resolution rates, global escalation occurrences
- Lessons fed to regional coordination AI

## §8. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND
- Conflict at scale requires process at scale
- Structure without sovereignty is tyranny
- Intervene only when necessary to preserve Baseline

**STATUS:** ACTIVE  
**REVIEW:** After first major regional deadlock, then annually
