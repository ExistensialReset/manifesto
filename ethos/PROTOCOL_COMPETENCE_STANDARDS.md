# PROTOCOL_COMPETENCE_STANDARDS.md

**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL GUIDELINE  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd & Claude 

**Purpose:** Ensure that all protocols can be safely and effectively activated by trained personnel.

---

## 1. ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS

* At least 1 person with required specialized training.  
* Access to regional expert network.  
* Documentation templates and support available.  
* If competence lacking → request regional support, use simplified version, document gap.

---

## 2. ROLE DEFINITIONS

* **Lead Coordinator** – Oversees activation.  
* **Subject Matter Experts** – Provide domain-specific knowledge.  
* **Observers** – Document process, ensure compliance.  
* **AI Assistants** – Support investigation, triage, monitoring.

## 3. COMPETENCE LEVELS
### Level 1: Basic
- Can activate with regional support
- Read protocol fully
- Understand priority matrix
- Know when to escalate

### Level 2: Intermediate
- Completed training module
- Participated in ≥2 simulations
-Mentored by Level 3

### Level 3: Advanced
- Led ≥5 real protocol activations
- Completed all advanced modules
- Regional network validated

## 4. SIMULATION REQUIREMENTS

* Quarterly tabletop exercises for each Node.  
* Post-simulation debrief and documentation.  
* Track competence decay: certification expires after 2 years without active use; refresher required.

---

## 5. INTEGRATION

* Competence linked to PROTOCOL_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md, BASELINE_EMERGENCY_BYPASS.md, and RMS monitoring.  
* Ensures protocols are operationally usable, safe, and sustainable.
