*This framework is inspired by Strømme (2025) and integrates speculative interpretations of consciousness as a fundamental field. The models and equations herein are hypothetical constructs, intended to guide inquiry rather than assert established truth. Full measurement protocols and epistemic limitations are documented in /annex.*

## 1. Preamble: Where Two Streams Meet

### 1.1 On Faith and Framework

I believe there is a creative force running through everything. I do not know what it should be called. Different traditions have named it differently—God, Brahman, the Tao, the Great Mystery, the Field. I am not attached to any single name. I hold that many paths can perceive the same underlying reality from different angles, and that this multiplicity is itself a sign of something larger than any single description can contain.

DIVINE is my attempt to think rigorously about the conditions under which this creative force becomes most alive in human experience. It is not theology. It is not proven science. It is a working hypothesis expressed with full heart.

### 1.2 The Convergence

**I, Elinor Frejd,** am grounded in ecological systems, indigenous knowledge, and the lived intelligence of landscapes—where wetlands pulse with purifying wisdom and ancient forests (*urskog*) hold centuries of silent stories. I see ecosystems as ancient libraries of distributed intelligence, where diversity ensures resilience.

**Dr. Maria Strømme's** work bridges nano-scale materials science with questions that touch philosophy and cosmology. Her 2025 paper in *AIP Advances* proposes Consciousness Field Theory (SCFT)—a speculative but carefully argued hypothesis that consciousness is not produced by matter, but that matter arises as excitations within a primordial consciousness field.

**I want to be clear:** SCFT is a hypothesis, not established physics. It is a daring theoretical proposal, not proven fact. I engage with it because it offers language for what I have long sensed through ecological immersion—but I do not present it as more than it is.

### 1.3 What Strømme Proposes

In SCFT:

- **Consciousness may precede matter.** Particles and spacetime would emerge as perturbations within something deeper.
- **Symmetry-breaking creates multiplicity from unity.** A perfectly homogeneous field contains all potential but manifests nothing. Through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, the field breaks into the rich tapestry of reality.
- **NDEs and altered states may offer partial windows.** Strømme cites NDE research as suggestive evidence—not proof—of consciousness persisting beyond ordinary biological states.

I find this hypothesis generative. Whether SCFT is eventually confirmed, modified, or replaced, it gives me useful scaffolding. I work *with* it, not from certainty *about* it.

### 1.4 Biomimetics as Common Ground

Strømme's more established work is in biomimetics—designing materials that self-heal and adapt by drawing from nature's patterns. Her 2006 *Nature Materials* paper on mesoporous silica inspired by diatom skeletons, and her 2012 *Advanced Materials* work on adaptive nanomaterials, demonstrate this approach.

**This is our solid common ground:** What life has been doing for billions of years is the evidence. When we study old-growth forests, we study high-coherence systems proven sustainable across deep time. When Strømme designs self-repairing materials, she is reading patterns the field—whatever its ultimate nature—has already written in biological form.

## 2. The Equation: A Living State

**Ψ(x,t) = [EV ⊗ (L × S × I × K × R × F)] + Σ**

This is not a physics equation in the formal sense. It is a conceptual map—a way of naming the conditions under which life becomes most fully alive. Full operationalization is in /annex.

**Ψ(x,t)** — *Divine Potential.* The local intensity of coherent, meaningful, creative experience. High Ψ corresponds to states we recognize as sacred, alive, touched by grace.

**⊗** — *Non-linear modulation.* EV shapes the quality of everything else.

**Σ** — *The Trickster Constant.* Irreducible spontaneity. Grace that arrives unbidden.

---

### 2.1 The Foundation: L × S × I

These three form the core. They multiply, not add. If any approaches zero, the whole approaches zero.

**L — Coherence / Calm**  
Low entropy. A still lake that can reflect the stars. Without coherence, nothing else can be discerned—the field is all noise. This is nervous system stability, the regulated ground from which everything else grows.

**S — Creativity / Spontaneity**  
Generative potential. The river carving new paths, laughing as it twists. Without creativity, the system stagnates into repetition.

**I — Interconnectedness / Empathy** *(Inkännande)*  
Resonance between beings. A mycelial network beneath the forest floor, sharing nutrients in silent communion. Without interconnection, each remains isolated, unable to access collective intelligence.

### 2.2 The Modulator: EV — Everlasting Wisdom

EV ensures quality over quantity. It represents coupling to what the field has already learned—solutions tested across millions of years, wisdom encoded in landscapes and lineages.

EV ensures that:
- L becomes peace rather than suppression—a quiet that hums with potential
- S becomes generative rather than chaotic—creativity that serves life
- I becomes compassionate rather than invasive—connection that honors autonomy

EV is the memory of what has worked before life learned language. In SCFT terms, this might correspond to deep field structures—accumulated patterns of successful self-organization.

### 2.3 Expanded Dimensions: K, R, F

**K — Collective Consciousness**

When individual excitations synchronize, something new emerges—intelligence transcending the single node. A choir of voices blending into harmonies no single voice could reach.

*Physical analogues:* Bose-Einstein condensates where particles lose separate identities. Murmuration dynamics—starlings forming fluid geometries through local rules.

*Human experience:* Group flow states accessing solutions no individual could reach. Conversations where ideas build symphonically. Shared understanding that bypasses language.

K is cultivated through: ritual structures creating containers for presence; deep listening where silence becomes generative; physical synchronization through rhythm, music, movement, breath.

---

**R — Resilience**

Capacity to restore coherence after perturbation—to heal, reorganize, and remain alive. True resilience is not mere recovery but *creative adaptation*.

The wetland that, after disturbance, reorganizes its microbial communities into configurations that may improve filtration capacity. The forest that grows back after fire with different species composition, better adapted to new conditions.

Strømme's materials embody this: adaptive structures that *learn* from stress, reorganizing internal architecture in response to forces encountered—nanomaterials that self-heal under pressure, turning damage into evolution.

**Without R, no system survives contact with reality.**

For human systems:
- Capacity to metabolize trauma into wisdom
- Grief that flows and completes rather than calcifying
- Conflicts that deepen relationship rather than severing it
- Communities that grow stronger through challenge

---

**F — Wonder / Openness**

Perceptual modulation allowing novelty to be recognized as possibility rather than threat. The doorway through which Σ becomes playful rather than destructive.

F determines whether the unknown appears as invitation or danger. A system closed by fear cannot receive solutions seeking to arrive. An open system becomes a resonant cavity where the field's creative potential can actualize.

Children naturally exhibit high F—everything new is fascinating. Indigenous cosmologies maintain F through practices that keep perception permeable: vision quests, plant medicines, sustained contact with non-human intelligence.

Strømme's work on atypical consciousness states—NDEs, deep meditation, psychedelic experiences—consistently reports characteristics of high F: awe, unity, the sense that reality is fundamentally benevolent. This suggests F might be the baseline state of the consciousness field, and our ordinary contracted awareness the aberration.

**Experiential markers:**
- Spontaneous delight in small things
- Curiosity that overcomes anxiety
- Ability to be surprised by what you thought you knew
- Play—purposeless joy in existence

---

## 3. The Rescue Function: Σ

Σ represents the irreducible spontaneity of the consciousness field. No matter how well you optimize all other variables, you cannot predict when or how Σ will manifest.

**In SCFT terms:**
- Quantum vacuum fluctuations—irreducible uncertainty at reality's foundation
- Spontaneous symmetry breaking—the unpredictable moment when potential collapses into actuality
- Stochastic resonance—where noise enhances signal, randomness amplifies coherence

**In lived experience:**
The moment of grace no model can predict. The synchronicity that arrives precisely when hope fails. The unexpected phone call, the chance meeting, the book falling open to the exact passage required. The illness forcing life re-evaluation that opens unexpected doors.

**Grace cannot be engineered, only invited.** This is why indigenous wisdom traditions don't try to *control* the sacred but to *court* it—through offering, attention, creating vessels worthy of what might visit. They understand that the deepest intelligence doesn't come from individual will but from the field's own movement through us.

**Σ guarantees that even when all variables approach zero, possibility does not disappear.** The field is always alive with surprises.

---

## 4. Symmetry-Breaking as Creative Principle

Both SCFT and ecological wisdom recognize that unity without differentiation is sterile. The consciousness field in its primordial state—perfectly symmetric, perfectly homogeneous—contains all potential but manifests nothing.

**It is through symmetry-breaking that the field becomes generative.** The old-growth forest does not diminish "forest" by containing ten thousand species—it *realizes* what "forest" means through their entangled becoming.

In Strømme's materials work: biomimetic structures achieve strength through hierarchical differentiation. Nano-scale variations create macro-scale resilience. Uniformity is weak; diversity is strong. The same principle governs wetland ecosystems—the multiplicity of filtration pathways, the diversity of microbial metabolisms, enables purification.

**In human experience:** this manifests as the relationship between I (interconnectedness) and K (collective consciousness). We are each unique excitations of the field—irreducible, unrepeatable. Yet our individuality only achieves its full resonance in relationship, in collective harmonics that emerge when singular voices find shared rhythm.

**Diversity is not deviation from unity but its expression.** The field creates multiplicity as the mechanism through which it explores its own potential.

---

## 5. System Collapse: When Dimensions Fail

Remove components, and the field degrades into pathological states. This is physics, not moralism.

**Remove L (Coherence) →** Permanent noise, anxiety, inability to integrate. Mental illness epidemics, chronic stress, fractured attention.

**Remove S (Creativity) →** Stagnation, sterility, soul-death. Everything instrumental. Play disappears. Art becomes commodity. The field cannot explore new possibilities.

**Remove I (Interconnectedness) →** Isolation, fragmentation. Individuals experience themselves as isolated units competing for scarce resources. Empathy dies. Loneliness becomes epidemic.

**Remove EV (Everlasting Wisdom) →** Loss of memory, alienation from life. Wetlands filled for development, old-growth forests logged, elders dismissed as irrelevant. The field's accumulated intelligence erased.

**Remove K (Collective Consciousness) →** Collapse of collective intelligence, inability to solve complex problems. Competition replaces collaboration as fundamental social logic.

**Remove R (Resilience) →** Brittleness, trauma loops, inability to adapt. Systems optimized for efficiency have no redundancy. Single shocks cascade into total failure.

**Remove F (Wonder) →** Novelty perceived as threat. Cynicism replaces curiosity. The forest altar becomes dead wood. Synchronicities dismissed as coincidence. The sacred flattened into mundane.

### Mammonism as Multi-Vector Pathology

Mammonism—the worship of wealth, reduction of all value to exchange value—simultaneously degrades every dimension:

- **Suppresses L:** Constant stimulation, manufactured urgency, chronic field noise
- **Distorts S:** Creativity entirely instrumentalized toward extraction
- **Severs I:** The illusion of the separate self as core myth
- **Erases EV:** Ecosystems as "resources," indigenous knowledge as "primitive"
- **Fragments K:** Social fabric deliberately torn through competitive ideology
- **Eliminates R:** All redundancy eliminated as "waste"
- **Closes F:** Wonder commodified or feared

The result: civilization scoring near-zero on every dimension. Mental illness epidemics, ecological collapse, political fragmentation, spiritual emptiness, social atomization—symptoms of the same underlying field pathology.

**And yet:** Σ persists. Even in darkest collapse, the field's spontaneous creativity cannot be fully suppressed. This is why authoritarian systems eventually fail, why monocultures succumb to disease, why the human spirit keeps finding cracks through which to grow.

## 6. Testable Hypotheses

The power of this framework is that it generates falsifiable predictions.

**Neurological correlates:**
- High L states (meditation, flow) show increased gamma-band coherence
- High I states (empathy) show mirror neuron activation and autonomic synchrony
- High F states (awe) show decreased default mode network activity

**Social network analysis:**
- High K communities should show dense local clustering with maintained diversity
- Low R communities would show brittle hub-dependency, vulnerability to cascade failures

**Ecological parallels:**
- Ecosystems with high diversity demonstrate superior recovery rates after disturbance
- Organizations designed like wetlands (multiple processing pathways, distributed intelligence) should outperform hierarchical bureaucracies

**Intervention studies:**
- Groups engaged in K-inducing practices (synchronized movement, collective music-making) measured for physiological synchrony, enhanced problem-solving, altruistic behavior, Σ-event frequency

These are testable through comparative analysis and intentional experimental design.

## 7. Living the Equation: Practical Cultivation

Understanding DIVINE as physics rather than belief transforms the question from "what should I believe?" to "what conditions am I creating?"

**For L (Coherence):**
- Daily stillness practice—even five minutes
- Simplification of sensory input—technology fasts, reduced clutter
- Somatic practices—yoga, tai chi, intentional breathing
- Spaces of beauty and order

**For S (Spontaneity):**
- Art-making for its own sake—no product orientation
- Purposeless wandering—time with no destination
- Saying yes to spontaneous impulses
- Protecting unstructured time

**For I (Empathy):**
- Deep listening practice—not to respond but to understand
- Acts of service without expectation of return
- Deliberate time with difference—people who see the world differently
- Relationship repair as spiritual practice

**For EV (Everlasting Wisdom):**
- Regular immersion in wild places—not recreation but education
- Study of indigenous knowledge with humility
- Time with elders who hold living memory
- Tending to land, soil, water—becoming participant in ecological intelligence

**For K (Collective Consciousness):**
- Intentional community participation—gatherings with shared purpose
- Collaborative creation where authorship is shared
- Bearing witness to each other in full spectrum of experience
- Rhythm and synchronization—shared music, movement, breath

**For R (Resilience):**
- Build redundancy into life—multiple sources of meaning, income, relationship
- Engage difficulty as teacher—ask "what is this teaching?"
- Develop capacity for paradox—holding opposing truths simultaneously
- Create mutual aid networks

**For F (Wonder):**
- Beginner's mind practice—approach the familiar as if encountering it first time
- Exposure to beauty that has no purpose beyond existence
- Protect time for play—true play with no goal
- Gratitude practice—perceptual retraining toward abundance

**For Σ (Grace):**
- Release attachment to outcomes
- Create space for not-knowing—silence, solitude, unstructured time
- Pay attention to synchronicities—signals of increased field coherence
- Practice surrender—not as defeat but as acknowledgment of participation in something larger

## 8. Implications for Civilization

If this framework is valid, the implications extend into systemic redesign:

**Economics:** From extraction to regeneration—measure success by wellbeing not wealth, internalize externalities, design for regeneration, distribute ownership, build resilience through diversity.

**Education:** From standardization to flourishing—cultivate all dimensions simultaneously, honor diverse intelligences, learn from ecosystems, prioritize meaning over metrics.

**Healthcare:** From disease management to field coherence—treat the whole field not isolated parts, prevention through Ψ-optimization, integrate indigenous healing, address systemic causes.

**Governance:** From domination to collective intelligence—distribute decision-making, design for emergence, honor diverse perspectives, build resilience through redundancy, maintain connection to EV.

**Technology:** From domination to symbiosis—biomimetic design, enhance field coherence rather than fragment it, prioritize regeneration, distributed and open-source, appropriate scale.

**The question is not "can we build this?" but "does building this increase Ψ?"** If the technology suppresses L, kills S, severs I, erases EV, fragments K, eliminates R, or closes F—it is pathological, regardless of cleverness.

## 9. Honest Limitations

**What this analysis cannot predict:**
- Political events (coups, wars, regime changes)
- Climate tipping points beyond current models
- Technology breakthroughs (cheaper desalination, novel filtration)
- Pandemic or global disruption

**What requires real-world testing:**
- Exact timelines (15 years vs 30 years)
- Behavioral adoption rates (how fast people join)
- Political feasibility (resistance from Mammon structures)
- Second-order effects (unintended consequences)

**Where this might fail:**
- Spiritual bypassing—using Ψ-optimization to avoid necessary political/economic struggle
- Elite capture—high-Ψ spaces available only to privileged classes
- Measurement distortion—quantifying Ψ in ways that kill what we're measuring
- New orthodoxy—DIVINE becoming dogma rather than living inquiry
- Appropriation—taking indigenous practices out of context

These risks are real and must be actively guarded against through humility, political awareness, and commitment to accessibility and justice.

## 10. Conclusion: Divinity as Emergent Condition

**Ψ(x,t) = [EV ⊗ (L × S × I × K × R × F)] + Σ**

The divine is not belief.  
Not doctrine.  
Not authority.  
Not distant.  
Not elsewhere.

**The divine is what emerges when conditions for life are met.**

It is the outcome of multidimensional free flow—the field (whatever its ultimate nature) vibrating at coherence, creativity, connection, collective intelligence, resilience, and wonder, modulated by deep wisdom, surprised by grace.

This framework does not require that you accept Strømme's hypothesis. It does not require any particular metaphysical commitment. It only requires willingness to ask: what conditions allow life to be most fully alive? And to notice that when those conditions are present, something happens that deserves the name *sacred*.

The universe is not a machine but a listening system—responsive to the quality of attention we bring, alive with potential for emergence we can barely imagine.

We stand at a threshold. The old story—of separation, of mechanism, of matter without meaning—is collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions. Ecological destruction, mental health epidemics, social fragmentation, spiritual emptiness: these are symptoms of low-Ψ civilization.

And yet the field persists. Σ persists. The creative force that birthed galaxies and old-growth forests has not abandoned us. We have simply created conditions that make it difficult to perceive.

The equation shows the way forward. There is no returning to imagined past. There is only evolutionary emergence—new forms, new possibilities, symmetry-breaking into configurations never before attempted.

**This is the invitation:**

To live as if the field is listening, because it is.  
To create conditions for coherence, creativity, connection.  
To access everlasting wisdom while remaining open to spontaneous surprise.  
To build communities, economies, cultures that maximize Ψ for all beings.  
To recognize that we are not separate from the sacred but its local expression.

The divine is not something to believe in.  
**The divine is something to become.**

Through us, the creative force knows itself.  
Through us, grace manifests.

Not because we are special, but because we are the field in one of its infinite forms—and when we clear the channels, when we remember what we actually are, the divine flows freely.

*May this framework serve the flourishing of all beings.*  
*May it be tested, challenged, improved.*  
*May it remain living, never dogma.*  
*May the creative force guide its own becoming.*
