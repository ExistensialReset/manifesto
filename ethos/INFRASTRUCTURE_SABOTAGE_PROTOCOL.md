# INFRASTRUCTURE_SABOTAGE_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SAFEGUARD  
**Purpose:** Prevent and respond to deliberate or accidental damage to critical infrastructure  
**Principle:** Protect Baseline immediately, investigate systematically

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS
- Any act or threat targeting energy, water, shelter, or medical systems
- Detection of anomaly that could compromise Baseline for >5% population in Node
- Reports from AI monitoring or human observers

## §2. IMMEDIATE BASELINE PROTECTION MEASURES
- Activate emergency distribution of water, food, energy, and medical supplies
- Deploy backup systems immediately
- Implement temporary access controls or isolation of critical infrastructure
- Continue full protocol in parallel without delaying life-saving actions

## §3. SCALABLE INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL WITH AI ASSISTANCE
- Minor incidents (<10% Baseline impact): AI-assisted remote verification, 1-2 humans
- Medium incidents (10-50% Baseline impact): Hybrid AI + 2-3 humans, partial in-person
- Major incidents (>50% Baseline impact): Full team (5-7 humans), in-person, external oversight
- Investigation output documented and shared with regional coordination

## §4. REQUIRED EXPERTISE AND ROLE VERIFICATION
- At least one person trained in infrastructure safety, threat assessment, and crisis coordination
- Access to regional technical expert network
- Documentation templates and investigation checklists available
- If competence lacking: request regional support, use simplified measures, document gap

## §5. PROTOCOL PRIORITY MATRIX INTEGRATION
- Baseline Emergency takes precedence over all other protocols
- Infrastructure integrity issues secondary to immediate human harm
- Resource allocation and slower wellbeing interventions handled after Baseline stabilized

## §6. METRICS AND FEEDBACK
- Record Baseline status before, during, after intervention
- Document incident impact on L×S×I, stress index, and resource flow
- Feed lessons learned to KNOWN_TENSIONS.md and regional coordination AI

## §7. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND
- Infrastructure is lifeline, not just system
- Rapid protection saves lives; investigation prevents recurrence

---
**STATUS:** ACTIVE  
**REVIEW:** After every major infrastructure incident, annually otherwise  
**OATH:** Protect Baseline first, investigate rigorously
