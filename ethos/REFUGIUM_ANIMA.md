**The Sanctuary of the Soul**

A restorative space for returning to Flow — without diagnosis, justification, or timeline

## What Refugium Anima Is

Refugium Anima is a **physical and relational space** designed for people who have temporarily lost access to Flow.

Not because they are broken.  
Not because they are ill.  
But because **life sometimes overwhelms the nervous system** faster than it can recover on its own.

This is not a hospital.  
This is not a treatment facility.  
This is not a place of diagnosis, correction, or rehabilitation.

**Refugium Anima is sanctuary.**
