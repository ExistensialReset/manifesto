# FAQ: Logic vs. Friction

**Addressing the common objections to Existential Sovereignty.**

This document is a shield against legacy thinking. It uses logistical physics to answer questions often rooted in scarcity-based fear.

### Q1: "Isn't this project politically naive? No government will ever allow this."

**The Logical Answer:** This is not a political proposal; it is a **logistical inevitability**. We are not asking for "allowance" or waiting for legislation. 

Mammon-based systems are currently operating with an **estimated 25.5% parasitic loss**. As local Flow-nodes (Baseline Circles) begin to guarantee their own food, housing, and internet, they become more efficient than the state or the market. 

People don't join Flow because of an ideology; they join because it works better. It’s not a revolution; it’s **logistical gravitation**. When the replacement system is more stable and provides a higher quality of life ($Life = L \times S \times I$), the old system doesn't need to be defeated—it simply becomes obsolete.

### Q2: "Without money and the threat of hunger, won't people just be lazy?"

**The Mathematical Answer:** Empirical data (Open Source, Wikipedia, parental labor) proves that human contribution is driven by **Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose**, not just survival fear.

In fact, the current system *stifles* productivity through stress and suboptimal job-matching. By securing the **Baseline**, we release the energy currently trapped in survival mode. 

For essential but "undesirable" tasks, the system uses the **Flow Premium** (Inverse Desirability). If a task is necessary but has no volunteers, its "Flow Value" (recognition, access, priority) rises until the logistical need is met. It’s a self-balancing system based on genuine scarcity, not coerced poverty.

### Q3: "How can you cancel all debt without causing a global collapse?"

**The Systemic Answer:** Debt is a "legacy artifact" that is fundamentally incompatible with a Baseline-secured system. We don't "cancel" it in a moral sense; we mark it as **Existentially Null (EN)** because the variables no longer compute in the new architecture.

Preliminary simulations show that a Flow-based system reduces collapse risk significantly because it removes the cascading failures inherent in credit-based systems. By the time the debt system collapses under its own weight, the Flow-nodes will already be providing the Baseline. We aren't creating the crash; we are building the safety net for when it happens.

### Q4: "Is this just another form of Communism?"

**The Architectural Answer:** No. 20th-century Communism relied on **central planning**, which failed due to information bottlenecks and coercion.

Existential Sovereignty is **decentralized and voluntary**. 
* **No Central Committee:** Each node (Circle) self-optimizes.
* **No Coercion:** Access to the Baseline is unconditional (Axiom 1).
* **Open Source:** Anyone can "fork" the protocol and start their own node.

If Communism was a "walled garden," Flow is a **decentralized forest**.

### Q5: "Who has the power if something goes wrong?"

**The Ontological Answer:** The power is in the **Axioms**, not in people. 
* **Structural Impartiality (Axiom 5):** The system monitors logistics, not behavior.
* **Lex Custodia:** Any intervention (Veto) is strictly time-bound and must be transparently justified by logistical data.

There is no "leader" to corrupt because the system delivers the Baseline automatically. You cannot use food or housing as a weapon when they are guaranteed by logistical physics.

### Q6: "How do we start if we have no money?"

**The Practical Answer:** You start with **Redundancy (S)** and **Collaboration (I)**. 
1. **Identify Friction:** Map where your group is losing energy to Mammon (rent, interest, stress).
2. **Pool Logistics:** Don't pool money; pool resources. Share tools, space, skills, and food access.
3. **Build the Circle:** A group of 10-50 people can secure a significant portion of their Baseline through mutual aid and local production.

Every person who moves their "Point of Access" from a Mammon-system to a Flow-node increases the **Network Effect**, making the system stronger for everyone.
