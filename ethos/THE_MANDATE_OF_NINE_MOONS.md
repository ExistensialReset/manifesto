PREAMBLE: THE LAW OF THE WOMB

Some truths cannot be rushed.
Some decisions must grow in darkness before they can be born into the light.

This protocol is not a court.
It is not negotiation.
It is not democracy.

It is a womb.

The Mandate of Nine Moons is invoked only when all other Flow paths
— dialogue, mediation, shared simulation, restorative process —
have been fully exhausted, and a conflict remains that threatens:

· the Baseline of communities
· systemic integrity
· or the risk of latent or structural violence

A Mandate is a pregnancy of the collective.
Its outcome is not manufactured by argument alone,
but received through timed, embodied incorporation.

Its authority is absolute because its process is sacred.
Its time is fixed because life’s deepest rhythms are fixed.

---

§1. INVOCATION — THE CALL TO CARRY

A Mandate of Nine Moons may only be invoked after all of the following conditions are met:

1. The complete protocol stack of conflict resolution has been exhausted.
2. A deadlock is formally acknowledged by the Regional Circle.
3. The deadlock poses credible risk to Baseline, trust, or continuity.
4. A solemn consent vote is held in each conflicted community.

§1.1 Regional Silence

Upon invocation:

· A day of silence is observed across the affected region.
· Non-essential work pauses.
· The conflict is ritually transferred from individuals to the collective system.

This marks a transition from action-time to gestation-time.

---

§2. THE THREE LUNAR ORBS

Architecture of Gestation (Nine Moons)

The Mandate unfolds across three qualitative phases of being.

---

ORB I — THE ORB OF RECEIVING LIGHT

(Moons 1–3)

Purpose: Receptivity without reaction.

Practices:

· Seven Council Bearers retreat to Refugium.
· Mandatory silence regarding the conflict for the first week.
· Council may only:
  · Read submitted testimonies
  · Observe AI simulations
  · Walk, rest, and reflect
· Daily check-ins are limited to felt experience only:
  “I feel grief.”
  “This material tightens my body.”

Rules:

· No analysis
· No debate
· No solution-seeking

The task is ingestion.
To take the problem whole without dissection.

---

ORB II — THE ORB OF VIGOROUS TURNING

(Moons 4–6)

Purpose: Composting contradiction.

Practices:

· Deep dialogue begins.
· Perspective inversion rule:
    Any argument must first be voiced from its opposing position.
· Monthly Spjuver’s Day:
  · Dialogue while walking
  · Clay, drawing, embodied improvisation
  · Non-verbal exploration

Primary Output:

· The Map of the Impossible
    A document cataloguing ethical cliffs, paradoxes, and dead-ends.

No resolution is required.
Only honesty.

---

ORB III — THE ORB OF SILENT RIPENING

(Moons 7–9)

Purpose: Allow clarity to mature.

Practices:

· Solitude and synthesis.
· Drafting of the Birth Document.
· Final moon includes seven consecutive days of total silence between Council members.

The Birth

On the final day:

· The Council reconvenes.
· The Birth Document is read aloud once.
· It articulates:
  · the path forward most aligned with Baseline (L × S × I)
  · framed as systemic direction, not victory
· All seven sign.

The Mandate is complete.

---

§3. THE COUNCIL — BEARERS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE

§3.1 Selection

· Selected from a pre-established pool (age 25+)
· Recognized by peers for capacity to carry long-term consequence
· Randomized selection via transparent, auditable algorithm
· AI proposes; humans verify eligibility
· Service is once in a lifetime

Refusal is permitted once, without stigma.

§3.2 Safeguards

· Full Baseline held for entire duration
· Silent Attendant assigned (former bearer)
· Unlimited access to Refugium, nature, art, restoration
· Mandatory three-moon decompression after completion

Council Bearers are not workers.
They are gardeners of a decision.

---

§4. THE CHILD AND THE DICE

Return to Innocence — Final Contingency Only

§4.1 Testimony of Impotence

If, at the end of Orb III, no ethical path can be born,
the Council may issue a Testimony of Impotence.

This triggers the rarest ritual.

§4.2 Absolute Safeguards

· No religious framing
· No sacrificial language
· No symbolic attribution to the child
· No impact on individual persons or bodies
· External verification of consent
· Permanent anonymization
· Pre-Casting Veto:
    Immediately before the casting, in a private chamber, the child's primary caregivers are asked, alone with a neutral advocate:
    "Do you, with full understanding, permit your child's hand to be the instrument of this final step?"
    A unanimous and explicit 'Yes' from all caregivers is required. Any hesitation, doubt, or 'No' immediately and irreversibly halts the procedure.

§4.3 The Procedure & Consequence of "No"

1. The Dice
   · Crafted from stone or tree significant to the lands
   · Sanctified through travel, not ceremony
2. The Child & The Veto
   · One six-year-old selected randomly from wider bioregion
   · Shielded, honored, never recorded
   · The Final Question: The child's caregivers are asked the veto question in private.
     · If Yes, proceed.
     · If No, the ritual ends here.
3. Consequence of a "No" Veto
   · The casting is cancelled. The dice is never cast.
   · The outcome of the Mandate defaults permanently to "Structured Coexistence" as defined in SHARED_RESOURCE_CONFLICT.md — the two parties must share or alternate the contested resource under binding, AI-monitored terms, in perpetuity.
   · This outcome is final. No further appeal or Mandate is permitted for this conflict.
   · The child and family return to their lives with their anonymity intact, supported and respected. Their "No" is recognized as the highest act of systemic integrity: the protection of a child's peace over procedural completion.
4. The Casting (If Veto is Yes)
   · Dice is cast once, publicly, in silence
   · Outcome decides between final irreducible options
5. The Acceptance
   · No debate
   · No celebration
   · Representatives shake hands in contract

The dice is buried.
The child’s name is never kept.

---

§5. THE UNFORESEEN GUEST’S FEAST

After resolution (whether by Birth Document, Dice, or Structured Coexistence):

· No speeches
· No victory narrative
· An open potluck emerges organically
· Simple food, many fires
· Children run freely

No one speaks of the conflict.

Life resumes first.
Meaning follows later.

---

FINAL CLAUSE

A society that can lay down weapons is strong.
A society that can lay down certainty is wise.

A society that can lay down its own most sacred ritual to protect a single child's right to peace…
is alive, and it is free.

---

A living system proves itself not by what it builds, but by what it chooses not to break.
