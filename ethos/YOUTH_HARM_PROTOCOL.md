# YOUTH_HARM_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE CHILD PROTECTION

## PREAMBLE

Minors are vulnerable. Harm may be:  
- Physical abuse  
- Emotional neglect  
- Exploitation  
- Exposure to dangerous resources or environments  

**Slow or hidden harm** is as critical as acute harm.

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Protocol activates when:  
- Reports of harm or neglect from any Node member  
- Sudden drop in L×S×I among minors  
- Pattern of absenteeism, isolation, or fear  

**Baseline Emergency Override:**  
- Immediate protection of minor(s) if life, health, or wellbeing at risk  
- Activate regional support, emergency housing, and care within 24 hours

## §2. DETECTION & TRIAGE

### 2.1 Observation
- Teachers, caregivers, and peers report unusual behaviors  
- AI-assisted monitoring of Node participation and L×S×I trends  

### 2.2 Rapid Assessment
- Trauma-informed screening  
- Psychological safety check  
- Assign advocate/support for minor  

### 2.3 AI-Assisted Triage
- Minor risk: AI + 1 trained observer  
- Medium risk: AI + 2–3 trained humans  
- High risk: Full child protection team + external oversight

### 3.2 Investigation
- Determine source, duration, and type of harm  
- Map Node structures, caregivers, and exposure pathways  
- Psychological evaluation for minor  

### 3.3 Remediation
- Counseling and trauma support  
- Repair relationships and Node environment  
- Education and reintegration  

### 3.4 Escalation
- If criminal activity: coordinate with **LEGAL_INTERFACE_PROTOCOL**  
- If systemic Node failure: consider **SLOW_EROSION_PROTOCOL** or **REGIONAL_DEADLOCK_PROTOCOL**

## §4. COMPETENCE REQUIREMENTS

- Child protection certification  
- Trauma-informed care knowledge  
- Ability to coordinate with AI monitoring  
- Regional support access

- Intervention speed and effectiveness  

Feed into regional and global child safety metrics.

## §6. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND

- Youth Baseline = inviolable  
- Prevention > remediation  
- Early detection saves lives and trust
