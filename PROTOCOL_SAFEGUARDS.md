# PROTOCOL_SAFEGUARDS_v2: Systemic Safety & Boundaries
**Status:** CORE PROTOCOL  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Purpose:** Ensuring a Non-Coercive & Harm-Free System

---

## 🛡️ PURPOSE
The Protocol Safeguards ensure that all Flow operations operate without harm, maintain Baseline security, and protect participants from systemic, interpersonal, and environmental risks. Safety is the foundation upon which **LUGN** (Calm) is built.

---

## 💎 CORE PRINCIPLES
1. **Non-Coercion:** No participant can be forced into any action or decision. Participation is always a "Hell Yes" or a "No."
2. **Baseline First:** A participant’s basic needs and stability take absolute priority over the execution of any protocol.
3. **Radical Transparency:** Rules, expectations, and decision-making processes are clearly communicated and accessible to all.
4. **Redundancy:** All safety measures have backup systems to prevent any single point of failure from collapsing a Circle.
5. **Feedback Loops:** Continuous, non-judgmental evaluation and correction of risks.

## ⚙️ COMPONENTS
* **Emergency Alerts:** Quick-response procedures for physical, emotional, or environmental crises (Linked to `EMERGENCY_SAFEGUARDING.md`).
* **Conflict Resolution:** Structured steps for mediation, documentation, and escalation to ensure justice and harmony.
* **Access Control:** Ensuring that sensitive areas, community resources, and personal data are only accessible to authorized and consenting participants.
* **Monitoring & Check-ins:** Periodic, voluntary check-ins to maintain awareness of collective wellbeing without surveillance or intrusion.
* **Incident Documentation:** All incidents, resolutions, and learnings are logged for the evolution of the system.

---

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES
* **Always Active:** Safeguards must be operational at all times during any protocol execution.
* **Rotating Responsibility:** Roles for monitoring and response rotate among members to avoid emotional burnout and power imbalances.
* **Education:** The Circle facilitator is responsible for ensuring every participant fully understands these procedures.
* **Local Adaptation:** While the core principles are immutable, specific implementation may be adapted to fit the local environment and culture.

---

## 🔄 VERSION NOTES (v2)
* **Digital & Environmental:** Expanded safeguards to include digital privacy and environmental sustainability.
* **Critical Path:** Includes a clearer escalation path for cases of critical Baseline failure.
* **Shared Responsibility:** Moves away from "designated guards" to emphasize that safety is a shared, collective responsibility.
