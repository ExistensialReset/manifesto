# 🛡️ PROTOCOL_SAFEGUARDS.md: System Safeguards and Definitions

**Architect:** Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** HARDENED  
**Objective:** To prevent systemic mutation and protect the integrity of the Flow.

## 1. Social Recognition Score (SRS)
* **Definition:** A non-accumulative, logistical signal for resource prioritization. It measures resonance and contribution to the Flow ($L \times S \times I$), not human worth.
* **Safeguard:** A low SRS score is a technical indicator of low resonance; it can **never** affect or diminish a node’s access to the **Guaranteed Baseline (L)**. Existential safety is decoupled from social recognition.

## 2. Global Debt Pulverization
* **Definition:** The logical archiving and nullification of all historical contracts and debt instruments written under existential duress or scarcity-logic.
* **Logic:** This is not a "loss of capital," but a systemic upgrade to guaranteed vitality for all nodes. It removes the friction of past errors from the potential of the future.

## 3. The Silent Colony
* **Definition:** A logical quarantine and safe-haven for nodes that actively choose to maintain Mammon-logic (coercion, power-accumulation, and debt-enforcement).
* **Safeguard:** Nodes in the Silent Colony retain their full **Guaranteed Baseline** but are isolated from the global Flow and SRS-privileges. They remain in quarantine until they voluntarily choose resonance over friction.

## 4. Critical Reserve (CR)
* **Definition:** A floating, permanent buffer consisting of 30% of the total global capacity ($C_{global}$) to absorb unforeseen fluctuations or shocks.
* **Logic:** The CR ensures that the system is never "optimized" to the point of fragility. It is the mathematical guarantee that scarcity can never be re-engineered.
