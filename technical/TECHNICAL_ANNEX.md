## 1. GLOBAL RESOURCE CAPACITY ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Caloric Efficiency (Food)
- **Current State (FAO 2025):** Global food production is currently sufficient to feed approximately **10.2 billion people** (FAO et al., 2025).  
- **The Mammon Friction:** Approximately **32% of all food produced** (13.2% lost between harvest and retail + 19% wasted at consumption) is lost or wasted (FAO Food Loss Index 2025).  
- **Flow Optimization:** By shifting to *Local Capacity Sufficiency* and eliminating market‑driven standards, we recover a latent capacity of **30%** (conservative estimate).  
- **Result:**  
  - Gross production capacity (no waste) = 10.2B / (1‑0.32) = **15.0B people**.  
  - If Flow reduces waste to 10% (conservative): Flow capacity = 15.0B × (1‑0.10) = **13.5B people**.  
  - If waste reduced to 5% (optimistic): Flow capacity = **14.25B people**.  
- **Revised Claim:** Global food capacity under Flow: **13.5–14.25 billion people** (conservative‑to‑optimistic range).

### 1.2 Energy Entropy (Power)
- **Current State (IEA World Energy Outlook 2025):**  
  - Global energy demand: ~160,000 TWh/year.  
  - **Economically feasible renewable potential** (solar, wind, hydro): >395,000 TWh/year → **2.47× demand**.  
  - **Theoretical solar potential** (if 1% of Earth’s surface covered): ~15,000,000 TWh/year → **94× demand**.  
- **The Mammon Friction:** Fossil fuel subsidies (IMF 2025) total **$7 trillion** (explicit + implicit), ≈7.1% of global GDP, artificially delaying the transition.  
- **Flow Optimization:** Redirecting subsidies to decentralised microgrids and eliminating transmission losses/market speculation yields **12‑15% effective efficiency gain** (conservative).  
- **Revised Claim:** Renewable potential with current technology: **2.5–10× human demand** (conservative‑to‑moderate). Theoretical solar (requiring massive land use) could approach **100×**, but this is a long‑term possibility, not an immediate reality.

### 1.3 Water Capacity (New Addition)
- **UN Water (2025):** Global freshwater availability: ~35,000 km³/year; current usage: ~4,600 km³/year → **7.6× current use**.  
- However, regional distribution is highly unequal. Effective accessible surplus in populated regions: **2‑3×**.  
- **Flow Impact:** Reducing agricultural waste (70% of water use), eliminating bottled water, and implementing greywater recycling can save **30‑45%** of current use, extending effective surplus to **2.6‑2.9×**.  
- **Conclusion:** Water is regionally scarce but globally sufficient; Flow helps but doesn’t eliminate all regional challenges.

## 2. THE PARASITIC LOSS RECOVERY (GDP‑FLOW SHIFT)

Updated with 2025 data and conservative recovery ranges:

| Sector | Estimated Global Impact (Loss) | Recovery Potential | Source (2025 Update) |
|--------|--------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Marketing/Advertising** | ~1.1% GDP ($1.14T) | 90‑95% | Dentsu/WPP 2025 |
| **Financial Admin/Tax** | 4‑6% of Global Labor Hours | 40‑60% | OECD sectoral data |
| **Planned Obsolescence** | 15‑20% of Resource Throughput (~65M tons e‑waste) | 60‑80% | UN E‑Waste Monitor 2025 |
| **Food Waste** | 32% of Production | 30% | FAO Food Loss Index 2025 |
| **Fossil Fuel Subsidies** | ~7.1% of Global GDP ($7T) | 100% | IMF Fossil Fuel Subsidies 2025 |

**Total Recoverable:** **31‑36%** of current economic activity can be reclaimed without increasing extraction.

## 3. SENSITIVITY & RESILIENCE TABLES

### 3.1 Resource Scarcity Impact (The 70/30 Split)  
| Capacity Level ($C_{global}$) | Baseline Status (B) | CR Allocation | System Mode |
|-------------------------------|----------------------|---------------|-------------|
| ≥1.5× (Target)                | 100% (Saturated)     | 30% (Innovation) | **Lex Plenitudo** |
| 1.0× (Limit)                  | 100% (Secured)       | 0% (Stagnation Risk) | **Equilibrium** |
| 0.8× (Crisis)                 | 80% (Survival Mode)  | 0% (Redirected) | **Critical Recovery** |

### 3.2 Transition Logic (The Displacement)  
- **Phase 1 (Logic Bridge):** Simultaneous existence of Flow‑nodes and Mammon‑nodes.  
- **Phase 2 (Tipping Point):** When Flow‑node efficiency (due to zero friction) exceeds Mammon‑node profitability; projected around 2030 per IEA 2025 renewables growth.  
- **Phase 3 (Horizon):** Mammon‑logic becomes a mathematical handicap; the old system contracts under its own friction.

### 3.3 Ecological Impact Simulation (2026 Addition)  
- **E‑Waste Reduction:** 80% (from 65.3M tons) with modular, repairable design.  
- **CO₂ Savings from Food Waste Reduction:** ~0.84 billion tons annually (FAO 2025).  
- **Energy Gain:** Renewables addition of 4,600 GW by 2030 enables zero‑marginal‑cost grids, reducing global emissions by **20‑30%** in Flow scenarios.

## 4. SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGY & ASSUMPTIONS  
- **Assumption 1:** Human motivation (S) is positively correlated with Baseline security (B) – supported by behavioural economics.  
- **Assumption 2:** AI acts as a non‑sentient logistical optimizer, preventing conformity via diversity metrics.  
- **Assumption 3 (2026):** Planned obsolescence, amplified by software, drives ~50% of e‑waste; Flow shifts to modular, updatable designs.  
- **Methodology:** All numbers traceable to 2025 sources (FAO, IEA, IMF, UN); conservative ranges chosen where uncertainty exists.
