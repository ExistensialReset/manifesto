## 1. THE LIFE EQUATION
The mathematical core of existential sovereignty:
$$Life = L \times S \times I$$

* **L (Lugn/Calm):** Systemic stability and baseline security.
* **S (Spontaneity):** The 30% innovation buffer.
* **I (Inkännande):** Empathic integration and resource feedback.

## 2. RESOURCE ALLOCATION: 70/30 RULE

| Layer | Allocation | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline** | 70% (Locked) | Universal survival, health, and creative tools. |
| **Innovation** | 30% (Dynamic) | Luxury, research, art, and experimentation. |

## 3. SYSTEMIC FRICTION ELIMINATION
Total Recovered Latent Capacity: **31–36%** global efficiency gain. This is the "fuel" for the transition.

## 4. OPERATIONAL RED LINES
1. **Baseline Inviolability:** No contribution metric can ever restrict access to basic needs.
2. **RTC-Guardian:** Flows must not exceed ecological regeneration rates.
3. **Decentralization:** Redundancy factor $\geq 2$ for all critical nodes.

---

**CONCLUSION:**
The math is conservative. The resources exist. The transition is logistical.
