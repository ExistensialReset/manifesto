# 🌊 FLOW_SRS.md (The Logic of Existential Drive)

This document formalizes the logistical architecture for **Axiom 4: Lex Flow**. The Manifesto asserts that human motivation, when freed from Existential Fear (secured by the 30% CR), shifts from Mammon (Greed/Scarcity) to Flow (Curiosity/Meaning).

## 1. LEX FLOW: The Existential Imperative

**Definition:** Flow is the state of total absorption and optimal experience in an activity, driven by intrinsic curiosity, creativity, and the search for meaning. Flow is the highest expression of Existential Sovereignty.

**Logical Function:** Flow is the non-scarcity-based substitute for Mammon-driven labor. The absence of Flow contribution is defined as **Existential Stagnation**—a self-selected state, not a threat of material loss.

**Contribution Principle:** All contributions to Flow—scientific breakthroughs, artistic creation, advanced maintenance, or complex problem-solving—are logged and verifiable under open protocol.

## 2. SOCIAL RECOGNITION SCORE (SRS): The Access Protocol

**Definition:** The Social Recognition Score (SRS) is a dynamic, non-fungible metric that quantifies an individual's verifiable contribution to the collective Flow. SRS is the sole logistical key granting access to complex resources and influence.

### SRS Mechanism (The Anti-Mammon Protocol)

* **Non-Speculative:** SRS is earned, never purchased, traded, or leveraged against debt. It is tied only to the verified utility of the Flow contribution.
* **Decay Function:** SRS is subject to a controlled, slow decay rate over time to enforce continuous contribution.
* **Zero-Sum-Immunity:** The system ensures that the earning of SRS by one individual does not logically diminish the potential for another individual to earn SRS.
* **Allocation & Anti-Corruption:** SRS is allocated via **Protocol Metrics** or **Anonymous Peer Review Consensus**. For Consensus, reviewers must submit a **Verifiable Logical Rationale**. Reviewers whose scores consistently lack logical justification or drastically deviate from the consensus will have their *own* SRS subject to protocol decay/devaluation. This mechanism makes subjective corruption illogical and risky.

### SRS Tiers (The Access Logic)

Access to resources and influence is determined by SRS level, adhering to the principle of **Logistical Necessity for Creation**, not personal consumption.

| Level | SRS Requirement | Access Granted (Purpose) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level 1** | **0 SRS** | **Lex Necessitas (Baseline):** Guaranteed by the 30% CR. Covers housing, food, energy, and basic health. No contribution required. |
| **Level 2** | **Low/Active SRS** | **Flow Access (Shared Tools):** Access to shared advanced tools, standardized higher education, and regional travel rights. Requires active Flow contribution. |
| **Level 3** | **Medium SRS** | **Architect Access (Rare Resources):** Access to rare/complex materials, specialized research capacity, and high-influence positions within regional governance. Requires proven, high-value contribution. |
| **Level 4** | **High/Sovereign SRS** | **Existential Access (Ultimate Influence):** Access to systems requiring ultrakomplex logistics (e.g., unique research facilities, global system governance, space-based creation). Granted only when logistically necessary to *expand* system-critical Flow. |

**Conclusion:** The combination of an unassailable material baseline (CR) and a non-financial, merit-based access metric (SRS) proves that civilization's energy can be directed toward creation and exploration without relying on Mammon-logic.
