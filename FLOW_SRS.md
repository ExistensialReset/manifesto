# 🌊 FLOW_SRS.md (The Logic of Existential Drive)

This document formalizes the logistical architecture for **Axiom 4: Lex Flow**. The Manifesto asserts that human motivation, when freed from Existential Fear (secured by the 30% CR), shifts from Mammon (Greed/Scarcity) to Flow (Curiosity/Meaning).

## 1. LEX FLOW: The Existential Imperative

**Definition:** Flow is the state of total absorption and optimal experience in an activity, driven by intrinsic curiosity, creativity, and the search for meaning. Flow is the highest expression of Existential Sovereignty.

**Logical Function:** Flow is the non-scarcity-based substitute for Mammon-driven labor. Failure to contribute to Flow is defined as **Existential Stagnation**—a self-selected state, not a threat of material loss.

**Contribution Principle:** All contributions to Flow—scientific discoveries, artistic creation, advanced maintenance, or complex problem-solving—are logged and publicly auditable.

## 2. SOCIAL RECOGNITION SCORE (SRS): The Access Protocol

**Definition:** The Social Recognition Score (SRS) is a dynamic, non-fungible metric that quantifies an individual's verifiable contribution to the collective Flow. SRS cannot be used for baseline needs (guaranteed by the CR) but grants access to complex resources.

**Mechanism (Non-Speculative):**
1. **SRS is earned, never purchased.** It cannot be speculated upon, leveraged against debt, and it slowly decays over time to encourage continuous contribution to Flow.
2. **Access Rights:** SRS is the sole logistical key required to access complex, rare, or advanced resources and privileges (e.g., advanced research tools, specialized education, unique travel rights, high-influence positions within governance).
3. **Public Record:** All SRS allocations and contributions are visible under **Lex Dualis Veritas**.
4. **Purpose:** The system is engineered to reward advanced, meaningful contribution, ensuring that the highest levels of resources are allocated by merit (verified contribution to Flow), not by capital accumulation (Mammon).

**Conclusion:** The combination of a guaranteed material baseline (CR) and a non-financial access metric (SRS) ensures that civilization's energy is directed toward creation and exploration, rather than survival and competitive accumulation.
