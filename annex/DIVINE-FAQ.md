## ❓ 1. Basic Questions

**Q: What is DIVINE?**  
**A:**  
DIVINE is a framework to:  
1. Describe what makes life *alive* (Ψ = L × S × I, modulated by EV and Σ)  
2. Diagnose where systems block life  
3. Protect against using measurement as control  

> It is **not** a religion, therapy, or quick-fix.

**Q: Is this scientifically proven?**  
**A:**  
- Partially: components like HRV (L), complexity theory (S), and interpersonal neuroscience (I) have research backing.  
- The Frejd Equation as a whole is a **hypothesis**, not law.  
- SCFT (Strömme Consciousness Field Theory) is speculative ontology.  

> Status: Testable model, not established truth.

---

**Q: Is this “New Age woo”?**  
**A:**  
- **No**: Uses formalism, aims to be measurable, ethical safeguards included.  
- **Yes**: Talks about fields, resonance, Σ (grace), and consciousness seriously.  

> Best description: **poetic rigor** – scientifically ambitious but humble before mystery.

---

**Q: Can I use DIVINE on myself?**  
**A:**  
- **Yes, cautiously.** Use as a self-reflection lens, not as a scorecard.  

**Do:**  
- Observe where L, S, I are blocked  
- Identify Mammonological influences  

**Do NOT:**  
- Self-grade Ψ  
- Try to “optimize” yourself  
- Shame yourself for “low” scores  

> Ψ is a state, not a value.

## ⚙️ 2. Practical Questions

**Q: How long does a DIVINE observation take?**  
**A:**  
- **Calibration:** 45–60 min (first session)  
- **Observation:** 60–90 min  
- **Decompression:** 30 min (mandatory)  
- **Follow-up:** 1–2 weeks later  

> Total: ~3–4 hours over 2 weeks for basic audit.

---

**Q: How many people are needed?**  
- **Minimum:** 5 (for privacy-safe aggregated data)  
- **Optimal:** 8–15 (rich dynamics, not overwhelming)  
- **Maximum:** ~25 (subgroups form)  

> Solo use is only for reflection, **not measurement**.

---

**Q: Does it cost anything?**  
- DIVINE framework = **open source / free**  
- Costs may include: observer time, sensors (HRV), supervision  
- Knowledge should **never** be behind a paywall

---

**Q: Do I need HRV measurement?**  
- **No.** HRV is just one proxy for L.  
- Alternatives: self-report, somatic observation, qualitative interviews  
- Low-tech DIVINE is fully valid ✅

## 🧾 3. Ethical Questions

**Q: Can DIVINE be misused for surveillance?**  
- **Yes, if misused.**  
- Safeguards exist; stopping rules are non-negotiable  
- Misuse = Mammonology, not DIVINE  

**Q: What if data leaks?**  
- Prevent with local-first storage, encryption, deletion by default  
- If leakage occurs: disclose immediately, legal support, pause system  

**Q: Can minors be involved?**  
- Only with extreme safeguards:  
  - Parent consent + child assent  
  - No individual data, only aggregate  
  - Playful, non-clinical framing  
  - Right to stop anytime  
  - Professional oversight  

> When in doubt: don’t include minors.

## 🧠 4. Philosophical Questions

**Q: Is DIVINE a religion?**  
- **No.** Secular sacred: values mystery without requiring belief  
- Religion = requires faith; DIVINE = observation & testing  

**Q: Do I have to be calm, creative, and connected all the time?**  
- **No.** Low L, S, or I can be appropriate depending on context  
- DIVINE measures **field state**, not desirability  

**Q: What about people who thrive in Mammonology?**  
- Some gain meaning from competition or structure  
- DIVINE allows it if genuine Ψ arises  
- Often, it’s survival strategy, not true thriving  
- Test: Can they leave without collapse? If not, it’s dependence

## 🔢 5. Technical Questions

**Q: Why use a tensor product (⊗) for EV?**  
- EV transforms L × S × I quality; it is not just multiplication  
- Example: L without EV = empty calm; L with EV = profound peace  

**Q: Can we calculate exact Ψ?**  
- Technically yes, practically no.  
- Proxies are fuzzy; EV & Σ are hard to quantify  
- Better: **narrative description with numeric markers**  
- Example:  
  > "Ψ: high L (HRV 0.7), medium S (0.5), high I (0.8), robust EV, 2 Σ-events noted"

---

**Q: Status of Frejd Equation?**  
- Phenomenological, descriptive, not predictive physics  
- Comparable to: Maslow’s hierarchy, Nash equilibrium  
- Not comparable to: Newton’s F=ma, Schrödinger equation

## ⚡ 6. Misunderstandings to Correct

1. “DIVINE says I must always be creative” → No. S can be low temporarily  
2. “High Ψ = good person” → No. Ψ describes field-state, not morality  
3. “Meditation alone raises Ψ” → No. Context matters; individual effort insufficient  
4. “DIVINE is scientific truth” → No. Testable hypothesis; remain critical  

---

## 🏁 7. Conclusion

**DIVINE is:**  
- A thinking language  
- A diagnostic tool  
- An ethical watchdog against control  

**DIVINE is NOT:**  
- A universal solution  
- Proven truth  
- Risk-free  

> Use wisely, question often, leave if harmful.
