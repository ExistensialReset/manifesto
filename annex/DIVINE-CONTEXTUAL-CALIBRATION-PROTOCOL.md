# DIVINE – Contextual Calibration Protocol  
### “Listen Before You Measure”

**Status:** MANDATORY  
**Applies to:** All DIVINE-based observations, audits, or field measurements  
**Domain:** Ethical measurement, cultural safety, neurodivergent inclusion

---

## 1. Purpose

This protocol exists to prevent **contextual violence**.

No measurement is neutral.  
Every metric carries implicit assumptions about:
- what is normal
- what is healthy
- what counts as “presence,” “engagement,” or “flow”

The Contextual Calibration Protocol ensures that **DIVINE never measures people against an external norm**.  
Instead, each measurement is calibrated against the **group’s own lived expression**.

> We do not adapt people to the instrument.  
> We adapt the instrument to the people.

---

## 2. Core Principle

**Nothing may be measured before meaning is locally defined.**

L (Calm), S (Spontaneity), and I (Interconnectedness) have:
- no universal behavioral expression
- no culturally neutral proxy
- no neurotypical default

All indicators must be **co-created** with the observed group.

---

## 3. Mandatory Calibration Session

**Minimum duration:** 45 minutes  
**Participants:** Whole group + facilitator  
**Requirement:** Collective consent before proceeding

---

### Step 1 – Introduction of Intent (5 minutes)

The facilitator states:

> “Before we observe anything, we want to understand how safety, creativity, and connection show up *here*, for *you*.  
> There are no right answers.  
> Our tools must reflect your reality — not the other way around.”

No data is recorded during this step.

---

### Step 2 – Local Mapping  
#### “Words for What Is Alive Here” (20 minutes)

The group collaboratively defines **observable signs**, not abstractions.

| Concept | Signs of Presence (When It Exists Here) | Signs of Absence (When It Is Missing Here) |
|------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **L – Calm / Safety** | Concrete, visible, audible signals | Concrete signals of tension or guarding |
| **S – Spontaneity / Novelty** | Unplanned, generative expressions | Behavioral rigidity or suppression |
| **I – Interconnectedness** | Micro-signs of attunement | Fragmentation or social withdrawal |

**Rules:**
- Use specific examples (“what happened last week”)
- Avoid moral language (“good”, “bad”, “should”)
- If unsure, describe the opposite

**Facilitator role:**  
Encourage specificity. Do not correct. Do not suggest proxies.

---

### Step 3 – Baseline Exercise & Consent (15 minutes)

1. **Neutral Activity (5 min)**  
   Example: “Discuss something low-stakes, such as a good meal or natural light.”

2. **Observer Training (5 min)**  
   The facilitator practices noticing *only* the group-defined signals.

3. **Consent Check (5 min)**  
   The facilitator asks:

   > “Using these shared definitions, does it feel safe and accurate to proceed?  
   > Is anything missing, unclear, or misrepresented?”

**Without explicit consent, measurement must not proceed.**

---

### Step 4 – Protocol Adjustment (5 minutes)

The facilitator updates:
- `DIVINE-MEASURE.md`
- `DIVINE-MEASURE-LOG_TEMPLATE.md`

All generic descriptors are replaced with **group-specific language**.

---

## 4. Outcome

After calibration:
- Measurement becomes **interpretation**, not judgment
- Data reflects *their* field, not an imposed model
- Observation itself becomes a trust-building act

---

## 5. Non-Negotiable Rule

Any measurement performed **without** contextual calibration is considered:
- ethically invalid
- epistemically corrupted
- incompatible with DIVINE principles

---

*DIVINE measures reality as it is lived — or it does not measure at all.*
