# DIVINE – Ethical Decision Matrix  
### Responding to Low Ψ and Field Imbalance

**Status:** MANDATORY  
**Applies to:** Any action taken after observation or measurement  
**Domain:** Ethics, non-coercion, systemic safety

---

## 1. Purpose

This matrix exists to **block harm**.

Measurement produces asymmetry:
- someone observes
- someone is observed
- meaning can be weaponized

The Ethical Decision Matrix ensures that:
- data never becomes a demand
- insight never becomes pressure
- vitality is never forced

> Low Ψ is not a failure.  
> It is a signal requesting care.

## 2. Usage Rule

Before *any* intervention:
1. Identify the observed pattern (not just the score)
2. Consult this matrix
3. Follow the recommended ethical next step
4. Present all actions as **optional experiments**

Skipping this matrix constitutes a **system breach**.

## 3. Decision Matrix

| Observed Condition | Forbidden Action | Ethical Next Step | Rationale |
|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------|
| **Low Total Ψ** | Demand engagement, initiate “team building,” present scores as problems | Reduce pressure. Increase qualitative listening. Offer rest or spaciousness. | Systems under stress recover through safety, not demand. |
| **High S, Low L** (chaotic creativity) | Suppress creativity | Add gentle structure (time boxes, grounding rituals) | Structure creates safety without killing novelty. |
| **High L, Low S & I** (frozen coherence) | Demand ideas or collaboration | Introduce micro-risk in low-stakes formats | Warmth returns through safe exposure, not pressure. |
| **Low I, High L & S** (fragmented field) | Force emotional sharing | Create task-based interdependence | Connection grows through shared purpose, not forced intimacy. |
| **Σ anomalies labeled “negative”** | Remove or silence anomaly source | Study conditions that allowed emergence | Σ is vitality expressing itself unpredictably. |

## 4. Presentation Rule

All actions must be framed as invitations:

> “We noticed a pattern.  
> One possible experiment could be X.  
> Participation is entirely voluntary.”

No mandatory interventions are allowed.

## 5. Core Ethical Axiom

**You may not optimize life.  
You may only create conditions where life can recover itself.**

DIVINE exists to **protect the field**, not to improve performance.

*Ethics is not a layer on top of measurement.  
It is the gate that determines whether measurement is allowed at all.*
