# DIVINE – Psychological Safety Protocol  
### Handling the Experience of Having Been Measured

**Status:** MANDATORY  
**Applies to:** All participants after any observation  
**Domain:** Psychological safety, debriefing, decompression

---

## 1. Purpose

Being observed changes people.

Even when done gently, measurement can trigger:
- performance anxiety
- self-evaluation
- identity contraction

This protocol exists to **separate observation from judgment** and to prevent internalization of metrics.

> No one should leave a DIVINE session feeling rated.

## 2. Step A – Immediate Decompression (5 minutes)

A non-verbal, somatic reset.

Examples:
- shaking out limbs
- slow breathing with extended exhale
- standing, stretching, or walking briefly

**Rules:**
- no synchronization required
- no “doing it right”
- no discussion during this phase

Purpose:  
To signal that the observation state has ended.

## 3. Step B – Voluntary Reflection  
### “The Experience, Not the Score” (15 minutes)

No numerical results are shared.

Participants choose one mode:
1. **Verbal sharing**
2. **Anonymous writing**
3. **Silent presence**

Suggested prompts:
- “How did the session feel in your body?”
- “Was there a moment that felt spacious or tight?”
- “What did you notice about how we were together?”

If someone asks for results:

> “Right now we’re focusing on experience.  
> Any insights from the data need time to mature.”

## 4. Step C – Delayed & Pattern-Based Feedback

**Minimum delay:** 24 hours

When feedback is given:
- describe **patterns**, not scores
- use the group’s own language
- frame as observations, not evaluations

**Good:**
> “We noticed that when the discussion opened, the signs you described as ‘synchronized pauses’ increased.”

**Not allowed:**
> “Your S score was low.”

## 5. Core Rule

Measurement must never collapse into identity.

DIVINE measures **fields**, not people.  
Anyone harmed by the process signals a failure of protocol — not a failure of themselves.

It is what makes insight ethical.*
