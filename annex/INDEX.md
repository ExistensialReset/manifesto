# 📚 Annex Index – DIVINE System

> ⚠️ **Ethical Notice:**  
> This material may **never** be used for KPIs, performance metrics, rankings, or any form of competitive evaluation. DIVINE is for understanding, presence, and field awareness — not for control, comparison, or monetization.

## 🧭 Reading Order

Before diving into the annex, please **read `/principles/DIVINE.md` first**. It provides the conceptual foundation you need to understand all subsequent materials.

After that, the recommended reading order for the annex is:

1. `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` – Learn the anti-patterns and common pitfalls.  
2. `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` – Understand the limits, ethical boundaries, and exit criteria.  
3. Annex documents (detailed below).

## 🗂 Other Notes

- Each annex document is **interconnected**; concepts in DIVINE-PEDAGOGY, SOMATIC-PROTOCOLS, and TECH-STACK reference `/principles/DIVINE.md` as the foundation.  
- `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` and `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` provide critical context to avoid misuse.  
- Reading in the suggested order ensures understanding **before applying any tools or practices**.

---

## ✅ Quick Ethics Reminder

- DIVINE is **not a management tool**, **not a productivity hack**, and **never for KPIs**.  
- The system prioritizes **presence, relationality, and field awareness** over measurement and control.  
- Any attempt to turn it into a competitive metric or surveillance tool is **against the principles** and **must be rejected**.
