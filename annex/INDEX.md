# 📦 Annex Index – DIVINE Framework

> This document provides a complete map of the annex files in `/annex`.  
> It shows reading order, connections to `/principles` and `/guides`, and highlights practical tools for exploration.  
> **No KPIs, no performance metrics – only learning, reflection, and field awareness.**

---

## 📝 Reading Order

Before diving into annex materials, **start with the core principles**:

1. **`/principles/DIVINE.md`** – Understand the foundational framework of DIVINE.  
2. `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` – Learn pitfalls to avoid.  
3. `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` – Understand ethical and practical limits.  

> These three set the context for everything in the annex.

## 📂 Annex Documents

### 1️⃣ `DIVINE-PEDAGOGY.md` – Teaching DIVINE Without Dogma
- **Purpose:** Pedagogical approach for introducing DIVINE as a **thinking language**, not a manual.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Start with lived experience  
  - Teach through negative space (blockages)  
  - Inoculate against dogma  
  - Multi-modal learning (somatic, narrative, analytical, artistic, relational)  
- **Recommended for:** Anyone facilitating or learning DIVINE in groups.  
- **Connected files:** `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`, `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`

---

### 2️⃣ `SOMATIC-PROTOCOLS.md` – Body-Based Ψ Observation & Field Tuning
- **Purpose:** Guide to somatic literacy and embodied observation.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Pre-observation body check-ins  
  - Somatic markers for L, S, I  
  - Movement, breath, and presence exercises  
  - Trauma-informed practice  
  - Ethical boundaries for consent and participation  

---

### 3️⃣ `DIVINE-TECH-STACK.md` – Technical Infrastructure & Tooling
- **Purpose:** Minimal, ethical tech for supporting DIVINE observations.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Data minimalism and local-first architecture  
  - Ephemeral default: auto-delete after 7 days  
  - No individual tracking, no cloud by default  
  - Recommended stack: Svelte, Tailwind, Dexie.js, Web Crypto API  
- **Anti-features:** No analytics, no AI-assisted predictions, no KPI tracking  
- **Connected files:** `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`

---

### 4️⃣ `LEGAL-ETHICAL-FRAMEWORKS.md` – Legal Compliance & GDPR Alignment
- **Purpose:** Ensure ethical use and legal safety in all contexts.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - GDPR, HIPAA, and employment law considerations  
  - Parental consent and safeguarding for minors  
  - IRB/ethics review guidance  
  - Liability mitigation and participation waivers  
  - Cross-border and international considerations  

---

### 5️⃣ `RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.md` – Empirical Studies & Validation
- **Purpose:** Guides research on DIVINE in small groups and real contexts.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Mixed-methods pilot studies  
  - Physiological validation (HRV)  
  - Longitudinal tracking  
  - Cross-cultural calibration  
  - Σ-event mapping  
- **Connection:** Always reference `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` and `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` for ethical study design

---

### 6️⃣ `FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md` – Flow Observation Protocols (Practical)
- **Purpose:** The actual **step-by-step observation tools** for fieldwork.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Session setup  
  - Observation checklists for L, S, I  
  - Somatic, relational, and narrative cues  
  - Documentation templates  
  - Ethical opt-out and trauma-informed reminders  
- **Placement:** **Last in annex index**, as it synthesizes all other documents into actionable practice.

---

### Legend:
Arrows indicate recommended reading order.
- Annex documents build on /principles and /guides.
- FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md integrates pedagogy, somatics, tech, legal, and research guidance.

---

# ⚠️ Ethics & Anti-KPI Reminder
DIVINE is NOT a performance metric.
Do not create KPIs, dashboards, or gamification from these protocols.

The goal is reflection, awareness, and ethical practice, not productivity tracking.

Always connect observations to context, human experience, and consent.

---

### 💡 Tips for Accessibility & Use
1. Read slowly; absorb concepts before jumping to exercises.
2. Use multi-modal engagement: write, move, discuss, reflect.
3. Pair documents: pedagogy + somatics, tech + legal, research + observation.
4. Encourage discussion instead of certification or ranking.
5. Keep FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md as your field companion, last in the reading order.

### ✅ Summary
This annex index is designed to:
- Provide complete orientation to DIVINE annex materials.
- Maintain ethical clarity across pedagogy, somatics, tech, and research.
- Serve as a practical map for learning, teaching, and observing without metrics or KPIs.
- Keep FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md as the final, actionable document, synthesizing all previous guidance.
