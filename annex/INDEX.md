# 📂 Annex Index – DIVINE & Consciousness Field Framework

This index organizes all **technical and conceptual annex materials** for DIVINE and the Strömme Consciousness Field framework. It includes core flow guides, measurement protocols, practical scenarios, and supportive references to ensure proper understanding and safe application of field principles.

## 1. ⚡ Core Flow Guides – MUST READ FIRST

Essential for understanding **field principles** and avoiding systemic pathologies.  
These guides lay the foundation for safe and effective implementation.

### 1.1 `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` ⚡
- **Purpose:** Highlights common mistakes and misapplications that **block or distort the consciousness field ($\Psi$)**.  
- **Path:** `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`  
- **Notes:** Reading this first ensures awareness of **pathologies and dead field scenarios**.

### 1.2 `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` ⚡
- **Purpose:** Defines **ethical and systemic stopping rules** for interventions to preserve coherence, spontaneity, and interconnectedness.  
- **Path:** `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`  
- **Notes:** Critical for safe flow implementation; ignoring stopping rules risks **over-intervention and field fragmentation**.

## 2. 📊 Measurement & Practical Scenarios

### 2.1 `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE.md`
- **Purpose:** Translates the **Frejd Equation** into measurable proxies for **L (Calm), S (Spontaneity), I (Interconnectedness), EV (Wisdom), and Σ (Spjuver/Grace)**.  
- **Path:** `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE.md`  
- **Notes:** Essential for **systemic audits, field tuning, and empirical testing** of DIVINE principles.

### 2.2 `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE-LOG_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Purpose:** Standardized observation template for field audits. Captures **baseline, core variables, modulators, anomalies, and draft $\Psi$ calculation**.  
- **Path:** `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE-LOG_TEMPLATE.md`  
- **Notes:** Designed to pair with `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE.md` for operational use.

### 2.3 `/annex/THREE_PILLARS_FIELD_AUDIT_SCENARIO.md` ⚡
- **Purpose:** Hypothetical, fully inclusive field audit scenario using the **Three Pillars**:  
  1. Contextual Calibration Protocol  
  2. Ethical Decision Matrix for Low Ψ  
  3. Psychological Protection Protocol  
- **Path:** `/annex/THREE_PILLARS_FIELD_AUDIT_SCENARIO.md`  
- **Notes:** Demonstrates practical application of measurement, ethical decision-making, and post-observation care. Essential reading for all observers before implementing audits.

## 3. 📜 Foundational Principle Reference

### 3.1 `/principles/DIVINE.md`
- **Purpose:** Full exposition of the **DIVINE framework**, including the Frejd Equation and consciousness field theory.  
- **Path:** `/principles/DIVINE.md`  
- **Notes:** Reference alongside guides and measurement files for **conceptual grounding**.

## 4. 📝 Supportive /Guides References

These are **not annex materials themselves** but are highly relevant for understanding and implementing **flow principles**:

- `HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` → `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`  
- `WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` → `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`  

**Usage Notes:**  
1. Start with **Core Flow Guides** (⚡).  
2. Reference **Measurement & Practical Scenarios** for auditing and evaluation.  
3. Review `/principles/DIVINE.md` for foundational context.  
4. Use supportive guides as needed for **deeper operational understanding**.

---

## 5. 🌟 Tips for Practical Use

- **Mark ⚡ guides as “first read”** to prevent systemic or ethical mistakes.  
- **Pair measurement template with $\Psi$ scoring** for consistent field analysis.  
- **Keep `/principles/DIVINE.md` handy** to cross-check theoretical assumptions.  
- **Review stopping rules before interventions** to avoid overreach.  
- **Always respect the calibrated team-specific proxies** when observing L, S, and I.

**Remember:**  
The divine is not an opinion, nor a belief. It is **the physics of unblocked flow**.  
Safe application requires **awareness, measurement, and ethical restraint**.
