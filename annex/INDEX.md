# 📦 Annex Index – DIVINE Framework

> Complete roadmap of all annex materials in `/annex`.  
> Shows reading order, connections to `/principles` and `/guides`, and highlights practical tools for ethical exploration.  
> **No KPIs, no dashboards, no gamification – only reflection, awareness, and field integrity.**

---

## 📝 Reading Order

Before diving into annex materials, **start with the core principles and guides**:

1. **`/principles/DIVINE.md`** – Foundational framework of DIVINE.  
2. **`/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`** – Learn pitfalls to avoid.  
3. **`/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`** – Understand ethical and practical limits.  

> These three set the context for everything in the annex.

## 📂 Annex Documents

### 1️⃣ `DIVINE-PEDAGOGY.md` – Teaching DIVINE Without Dogma
- **Purpose:** Pedagogical approach for introducing DIVINE as a **thinking language**, not a manual.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Start with lived experience  
  - Teach through negative space (blockages)  
  - Inoculate against dogma  
  - Multi-modal learning (somatic, narrative, analytical, artistic, relational)  
- **Connected guides:** `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`, `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`

---

### 2️⃣ `SOMATIC-PROTOCOLS.md` – Body-Based Ψ Observation & Field Tuning
- **Purpose:** Guide to somatic literacy and embodied observation.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Pre-observation body check-ins  
  - Somatic markers for L, S, I  
  - Movement, breath, and presence exercises  
  - Trauma-informed practice  
  - Ethical boundaries for consent and participation  

---

### 3️⃣ `DIVINE-TECH-STACK.md` – Technical Infrastructure & Tooling
- **Purpose:** Minimal, ethical tech for supporting DIVINE observations.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Data minimalism and local-first architecture  
  - Ephemeral default: auto-delete after 7 days  
  - No individual tracking, no cloud by default  
  - Recommended stack: Svelte, Tailwind, Dexie.js, Web Crypto API  
- **Anti-features:** No analytics, no AI-assisted predictions, no KPI tracking  
- **Connected guides:** `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`

---

### 4️⃣ `LEGAL-ETHICAL-FRAMEWORKS.md` – Legal Compliance & GDPR Alignment
- **Purpose:** Ensure ethical use and legal safety in all contexts.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - GDPR, HIPAA, and employment law considerations  
  - Parental consent and safeguarding for minors  
  - IRB/ethics review guidance  
  - Liability mitigation and participation waivers  
  - Cross-border and international considerations  

---

### 5️⃣ `RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.md` – Empirical Studies & Validation
- **Purpose:** Guides research on DIVINE in small groups and real contexts.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Mixed-methods pilot studies  
  - Physiological validation (HRV)  
  - Longitudinal tracking  
  - Cross-cultural calibration  
  - Σ-event mapping  
- **Connected guides:** `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`, `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`

---

### 6️⃣ `FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md` – Flow Observation Protocols (Practical)
- **Purpose:** Step-by-step observation tools for fieldwork.  
- **Key Themes:**  
  - Session setup  
  - Observation checklists for L, S, I  
  - Somatic, relational, and narrative cues  
  - Documentation templates  
  - Ethical opt-out and trauma-informed reminders  
- **Placement:** **Last in annex index**, synthesizes all other documents into actionable practice.

---

## ⚡ Ethics & Anti-KPI Reminder

- No KPIs, dashboards, gamification, or productivity metrics.  
- Focus on **reflection, ethical practice, and human-centered awareness**.  
- Observations always connect to **context, consent, and lived experience**.

## 💡 Tips for Accessibility & Use

1. Read **slowly**, absorb before acting.  
2. Engage **multi-modally**: write, move, discuss, reflect.  
3. Pair documents: pedagogy + somatics, tech + legal, research + observation.  
4. Use FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md as **field companion**, last in reading order.  
5. Encourage **discussion**, not certification, ranking, or KPIs.

## ✅ Summary

This index ensures:

- Safe orientation to all annex materials.  
- Ethical clarity across pedagogy, somatics, tech, legal, and research.  
- Preservation of systemic coherence and field integrity.  
- FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md remains the **culminating, actionable document**.

> **Bottom line:** Annex materials are **reference, audit, and ethical tools**.  
> They are **not control manuals**. Honor stopping rules, local autonomy, and systemic coherence.
