# Annex Index

**Status:** EVOLVING / Reference & Audit Only  
**Purpose:** Organizes all **technical and conceptual annex materials** for DIVINE and the consciousness field framework.  
**Notes:** Core reading order is mandatory. Misuse risks systemic pathologies or field collapse.

---

## 1. Core Flow Guides ⚡ MUST READ FIRST

These are essential for understanding field principles and avoiding systemic pathologies.

### 1.1 `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` ⚡
- **Purpose:** Highlights common mistakes and misapplications that block or distort the consciousness field ($\Psi$).  
- **Path:** `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`  
- **Notes:** Reading this first ensures awareness of pathologies and dead field scenarios.  

### 1.2 `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` ⚡
- **Purpose:** Defines ethical and systemic stopping rules for interventions to preserve coherence, creativity, and interconnectedness.  
- **Path:** `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`  
- **Notes:** Critical for safe flow implementation; ignoring stopping rules risks over-intervention and field fragmentation.

## 2. Measurement & Quantification

### 2.1 `DIVINE-MEASURE.md`
- **Purpose:** Translates the Frejd Equation into measurable proxies for $L$, $S$, $I$, $EV$, and $\Sigma$.  
- **Path:** `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE.md`  
- **Notes:** Essential for systemic audits, field tuning, and empirical testing of DIVINE principles.  

---

### 2.2 `DIVINE-MEASURE-LOG-v3.1.md`
- **Purpose:** Observation and field logging template for applying the Frejd Equation in real-world contexts.  
- **Path:** `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE-LOG-v3.1.md`  
- **Notes:** Use this template to score L, S, I, EV, and Σ in individuals, groups, or organizations. References `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` for intervention guidance. Essential for systematic field audits and practical application of DIVINE measurement principles.

---

## 3. Foundational Principle Reference

### 3.1 `/principles/DIVINE.md`
- **Purpose:** Full exposition of the DIVINE framework, the Frejd Equation, and consciousness field theory.  
- **Path:** `/principles/DIVINE.md`  
- **Notes:** Reference this alongside guides and measurement files for conceptual grounding.  

---

## 4. Supportive /Guides References

These guides are not annex materials themselves but are **highly relevant for understanding and implementing flow principles**:

- `HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` → `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`  
- `WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` → `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`  

**Usage Notes:**  
1. Start with **Core Flow Guides** (⚡).  
2. Reference **Measurement & Quantification** for auditing and evaluation.  
3. Review `/principles/DIVINE.md` for foundational context.  
4. Use supportive guides as needed for deeper operational understanding.  

---

**Tip:** Mark the ⚡ guides as “first read” to ensure no systemic or ethical mistakes when applying DIVINE principles.
