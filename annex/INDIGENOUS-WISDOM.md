## Purpose 🌿

DIVINE benefits from centuries of **indigenous knowledge systems**, which offer deep insight into:

- The human-nature relationship  
- Community-based wellbeing

Indigenous wisdom is not just inspiration—it is **data, method, and ethics**.

## 1. Core Principles 🧭

1. **Relationality**  
   - Humans are part of a network of beings: plants, animals, spirits, ancestors  
   - Ψ is understood as **interconnected**, not just individual  

2. **Embodied Practice**  
   - Knowledge is passed through **rituals, stories, songs, and movement**  
   - Observation of body, breath, and interaction is primary  

3. **Collective Responsibility**  
   - Wellbeing is measured across generations and communities  
   - Individual flourishing cannot be separated from group health  

4. **Time as Cyclical**  
   - Past, present, and future are interconnected  
   - EV and Σ are observed through **long-term relational patterns**  

5. **Ethical Reciprocity**  
   - Knowledge comes with **responsibility to act wisely**  
   - Reciprocity governs observation, application, and dissemination

## 2. Integrating Indigenous Practices into DIVINE 🌾

### a. Observation
- Note **relationships between people and environment**

- Include **community-defined indicators** of flourishing alongside formal DIVINE measures  

### c. Story & Narrative

- Recognize that Ψ can manifest **symbolically** in stories, not just metrics  

### d. Ceremony & Ritual
- Participation (with consent) can reveal **Σ phenomena**  
- Observe seasonal, life-cycle, or healing ceremonies for **energy resonance patterns**

## 3. Safeguards & Ethics ⚖️

- **Consent is paramount**: never extract knowledge without clear permission  
- **Respect intellectual sovereignty**: do not publish or generalize sacred knowledge without guidance  
- **Avoid appropriation**: translate principles into **contextual methods**, not superficial practices  

> DIVINE must be a **partner, not a colonizer** of indigenous knowledge.

## 4. Practical Tips for Observers 🛠️

- Listen before measuring  
- Attend community events without agenda  
- Focus on **patterns, not individuals**, unless invited  
- Ask: “How does this practice support life, balance, and harmony?”  

> Indigenous frameworks can enhance Ψ understanding by showing **systems of resilience** over centuries.

## 5. Key Takeaways ✅

- Indigenous wisdom is **living, relational, and embodied**  
- DIVINE benefits from collaboration, not extraction  
- Respect, humility, and reciprocity are **non-negotiable**  
- Community knowledge can **teach us how Ψ thrives** across generations
