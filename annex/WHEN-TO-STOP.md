## Purpose

This document guides facilitators, observers, and participants on **when to pause or stop a DIVINE observation**.  
Stopping is **not failure**—it’s **ethical vigilance** and **self-preservation**.  
Ψ is fragile; respecting limits preserves it.  

---

## 1. Personal Ψ Warning Signs ⚠️

Stop if you notice any of these in yourself:

- Emotional exhaustion, anxiety, or irritability that **persists beyond normal fatigue**  
- Numbness or inability to feel basic L × S × I signals  
- Physical stress: heart racing, shallow breathing, headaches  
- Obsessive self-monitoring of Ψ or over-identification with scores  

**Rule of Thumb:**  
If 3+ warning signs appear simultaneously, **pause immediately** and engage in recovery practices.

---

## 2. Participant Warning Signs ✋

Stop if participants show:

- Distress beyond comfort, crying, panic, or withdrawal  
- Statements like: “I feel unsafe,” “I don’t want to continue,” or “Stop now”  
- Suicidal ideation or self-harm indications  
- Signs of dissociation, confusion, or trauma reactivation  

**Action:**  
- End session gently  
- Ensure participant has support and safe space  
- Debrief after the session if possible  

---

## 3. Systemic / Contextual Red Flags 🏗️

Stop observations if:

- The environment is **unsafe**, distracting, or coercive  
- Observers are **pressured** to produce data or “results”  
- Mammonological influence is creeping in (monetization, performance-based reward, exploitation)  
- Confidentiality cannot be guaranteed  

**Remember:** The field is more important than data. **Data can be collected again; ethics cannot be retroactively restored.**

---

## 4. Red Flags During High Ψ States 🌊

High Ψ can be **exhilarating but fragile**. Stop if:

- Participants are overwhelmed or hyperstimulated  
- L × S × I patterns spike in ways that indicate system strain  
- Signs of overexposure to Σ moments or resonance (e.g., intense emotional release)  

**Tip:**  
High Ψ is beautiful but **requires integration**. Always allow downtime, reflection, and grounding after intense sessions.

---

## 5. Professional Intervention Signals 🏥

Stop and refer if:

- Participant displays **persistent suicidal ideation**  
- Self-care is impossible for more than a week  
- Psychosis, dissociation, or severe trauma emerges  
- Substance use escalates dangerously  

**Note:** DIVINE is **complementary**, not a substitute for clinical care.

---

## 6. Observer Self-Check 🪞

- Stop if **observer stress exceeds safety thresholds**  
- Rotate observers regularly to prevent collapse  
- Maintain personal recovery routines (sleep, nourishment, grounding)  
- Record own L × S × I state and reflections  

**Remember:** Facilitator collapse is **contagious** to participants’ field.

---

## 7. The Principle of Stop 🛑

Stopping is **not failure**.  

- It protects participants, observers, and the integrity of Ψ  
- It models **ethical awareness** and boundary-setting  
- It allows the system to **reset, recover, and return stronger**  

> “Stopping in time preserves what could be destroyed by continuing.”  

---

## 8. Practical Protocol for Stopping

1. **Acknowledge internally:** Recognize the signal.  
2. **Communicate clearly:** “We are pausing for safety.”  
3. **Ground the field:** Breathing, quiet reflection, walk outside, journaling.  
4. **Debrief if possible:** Share observations, emotional state, and lessons.  
5. **Decide next steps:** Resume, reschedule, or terminate session safely.

---

## 9. Key Takeaways ✅

- **Stop early, stop often if necessary.**  
- **Ethical integrity over data collection.**  
- **Respect boundaries of all participants.**  
- **High Ψ requires care, not exploitation.**  
- **Stopping preserves the field, the system, and life.**
