# 📦 Annex – Reference & Safeguard Layer for the DIVINE Framework

> This folder contains **protective, technical, and conceptual reference materials** for DIVINE.  
> It exists to **prevent misuse**, ensure ethical application, and preserve systemic coherence.  
>  
> **No KPIs. No performance tracking. No optimization games.**  
> Only learning, reflection, and field awareness.

---

## ⚡ Ethics & Anti-KPI Reminder

- No KPIs, dashboards, gamification, or productivity metrics  
- No ranking of individuals, teams, or groups  
- No certification systems or compliance scoring  

**Focus instead on:**
- Reflection  
- Ethical practice  
- Context-sensitive observation  
- Human-centered awareness  

Observations must always connect to:
- Context  
- Consent  
- Lived experience  

---

## 💡 Tips for Accessibility & Use

1. Read slowly. Absorb before acting.  
2. Engage multi-modally: write, move, discuss, reflect.  
3. Pair documents for depth:
   - pedagogy + somatics  
   - tech + legal  
   - research + observation  
4. Use `FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md` as a **field companion**, last in the reading order.  
5. Encourage discussion and sense-making — **never certification, ranking, or KPIs**.

## ✅ Summary

This README ensures:
- Safe orientation to all annex materials  
- Ethical clarity across pedagogy, somatics, tech, legal, and research  
- Preservation of systemic coherence and field integrity  

**Bottom line:**  
Annex materials are **reference, audit, and ethical tools**.  
They are **not control manuals**.

Honor stopping rules, local autonomy, and systemic coherence at all times.

---

## 📝 Mandatory Reading Order

Before using any annex material, the following **must** be read in order:

1. **`/principles/DIVINE.md`**  
   Foundational theory: the DIVINE framework and Frejd Equation.

2. **`/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`** ⚡  
   Common misuses, dead-field scenarios, and systemic pathologies.

3. **`/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`** ⚡  
   Ethical, psychological, and systemic stopping rules.

> Skipping this order risks misunderstanding, harm, or irreversible field degradation.

## 📂 Annex Documents

### 1️⃣ `DIVINE-PEDAGOGY.md` – Teaching DIVINE Without Dogma
**Purpose:**  
Introduce DIVINE as a **thinking language**, not a belief system or manual.

**Focus:**
- Lived experience first  
- Teaching through negative space (blockages)  
- Anti-dogma inoculation  
- Multi-modal learning  

**Connected guides:**  
`HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`, `WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`

---

### 2️⃣ `SOMATIC-PROTOCOLS.md` – Embodied Field Awareness
**Purpose:**  
Support somatic literacy and body-based observation of Ψ.

**Focus:**
- Pre-observation grounding  
- Somatic signals for L, S, I  
- Trauma-informed participation  
- Consent and opt-out boundaries  

---

### 3️⃣ `DIVINE-TECH-STACK.md` – Minimal & Ethical Tooling
**Purpose:**  
Describe technical support without surveillance or extraction.

**Principles:**
- Data minimalism  
- Local-first by default  
- Ephemeral storage (auto-delete)  
- No individual tracking  

**Explicit anti-features:**  
No analytics, no prediction engines, no optimization loops.

---

### 4️⃣ `LEGAL-ETHICAL-FRAMEWORKS.md` – Legal Safety & Compliance
**Purpose:**  
Prevent legal and ethical violations across contexts.

**Coverage:**
- GDPR & data protection  
- Employment law considerations  
- Work with minors  
- Cross-border use  
- Ethics review & liability boundaries  

---

### 5️⃣ `RESEARCH-METHODOLOGY.md` – Studying DIVINE Responsibly
**Purpose:**  
Enable empirical exploration without reductionism.

**Focus:**
- Mixed methods  
- Small-scale pilots  
- Cross-cultural calibration  
- Longitudinal patterns  
- Σ-event mapping  

Always pair with:
- `HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`
- `WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md`

---

### 6️⃣ `FLOW-PROTOCOLS.md` – Practical Field Observation (LAST)
**Purpose:**  
Concrete, step-by-step observation tools.

**Includes:**
- Session setup  
- L / S / I observation cues  
- Somatic, relational, narrative signals  
- Documentation templates  
- Trauma-aware reminders  

**Placement:**  
This file is **last on purpose**.  
It synthesizes all previous annex material into careful practice.

---

## 📎 Measurement & Observation

- **`/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE.md`**  
  Conceptual and qualitative measurement framework for Ψ.  
  For reflection and audit — **not performance evaluation**.

---

## ⚡ Enforcement Notes

- ⚡-marked guides are **mandatory first reads**  
- Any project referencing DIVINE should document reading order  
- Misuse can create **irreversible field pathologies**

---

# Final Reminder:

DIVINE is not about efficiency.
It is about care, coherence, and restraint.
