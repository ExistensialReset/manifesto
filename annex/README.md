# Annex: Technical & Conceptual Materials for DIVINE

**Status:** Protective / Reference Only  
**Purpose:** Prevent misuse, ensure safe and correct understanding of DIVINE principles and flow.

---

## ⚠️ WARNING: Abuse-Resistant Protocol

These materials are **not playbooks**. They define:

- How consciousness fields behave ($\Psi$)  
- How systemic interventions **must** respect coherence, creativity, and interconnectedness  
- Metrics for measurement and audit  

Do **NOT** use these files as scripts for controlling humans, organizations, or ecosystems.  
Misapplication leads to **systemic pathologies**, field collapse, or ethical violations.

## 1. Reading Order (Mandatory)

1. `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md` ⚡  
   - Highlights common mistakes and dead-field scenarios.  
   - Must read first.  

2. `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` ⚡  
   - Ethical & operational stopping rules.  
   - Must read second.  

3. `/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE.md`  
   - Empirical and measurement framework for $\Psi$.  
   - Read **after understanding flow rules**.  

4. `/principles/DIVINE.md`  
   - Full theoretical grounding of DIVINE and Frejd Equation.  

> **Note:** Skipping steps risks misinterpretation and unintended field disruption.

## 2. Key Safety Principles

1. **Do No Override Local Autonomy**  
   - Field interventions must never coerce or force behavior.  

2. **Never Remove $\Sigma$ or EV**  
   - Randomness ($\Sigma$) and wisdom modulation (EV) prevent deterministic collapse.  

3. **Audit Before Acting**  
   - Use DIVINE-MEASURE metrics to verify field readiness and ethical boundaries.  

4. **Stopping Rules Are Binding**  
   - Follow `/guides/WHEN_TO_STOP_FLOW.md` strictly.  
   - Do not bypass just because the system appears “inefficient.”

5. **Field Respect is Non-Negotiable**  
   - Coherence ($L$), Generativity ($S$), and Interconnectedness ($I$) are primary.  
   - Do not intervene without alignment across all three.

## 4. Enforcement Notes

- Marked ⚡ guides must be **first read** before any annex material.  
- Any project or audit referencing DIVINE must **document order of reading**.  
- Misuse or misunderstanding can create irreversible field pathologies.

**Bottom Line:** This annex is a **reference, audit, and conceptual tool**.  
It is **not a control manual**. Always honor local autonomy, stopping rules, and systemic coherence.
