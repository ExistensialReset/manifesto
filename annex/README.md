# Annex Overview: Measuring the Divine Field

This annex houses the technical and poetic expansions of the **Frejd Equation** and the **Strömme Consciousness Field Theory (SCFT)**. It serves as a bridge between intuition, science, and practical design.

## 1. Purpose
The goal of this annex is to provide frameworks for **observing, quantifying, and interacting** with the consciousness field ($\Psi$) in human and systemic contexts. It guides measurement, design, and field tuning in both experimental and experiential ways.

## 2. Key Documents

### 2.1 DIVINE-MEASURE-TECH.md
- **Focus:** Precise, operational metrics
- **Audience:** Scientists, designers, systems engineers
- **Goal:** Translate the Frejd Equation into measurable proxies for Coherence (L), Creativity (S), Interconnectedness (I), Wisdom (EV), and Grace (Σ)

### 2.2 DIVINE-MEASURE-POETIC.md
- **Focus:** Experiential, intuitive understanding
- **Audience:** Practitioners, educators, anyone seeking embodied resonance
- **Goal:** Convey the *felt sense* of the field, while maintaining connection to the measurable variables

## 3. Usage
- Technical teams can use **DIVINE-MEASURE-TECH.md** for audits, systemic design, and field experiments.  
- Educators, facilitators, and community builders can use **DIVINE-MEASURE-POETIC.md** to **invite flow and resonance**, guide participatory exercises, or communicate complex concepts in an intuitive way.

**Note:** Both documents reference the same underlying equation, principles, and constants. They are complementary: one speaks in metrics, the other in lived experience.
