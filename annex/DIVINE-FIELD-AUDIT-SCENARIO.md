# DIVINE Field Audit Scenario  
### A Neuro-Inclusive, Culturally-Calibrated Reference Implementation

> **Status:** Annex / Reference Scenario  
> **Scope:** Illustrative, non-normative  
> **Purpose:** Demonstrates how DIVINE field audits can be conducted ethically, inclusively, and without coercive optimization.

---

## Overview

This document presents a **hypothetical field audit scenario** using the DIVINE framework and the Three Core Pillars:

- **L — Calm / Coherence**
- **S — Spontaneity**
- **I — Interconnectedness**

The scenario is designed as a **reference implementation**, not a prescription.  
It prioritizes **pattern recognition over numerical scoring**, and **care before insight**, especially in culturally diverse and neurodivergent contexts.

---

## Context

A small, diverse creative team (5 people) in a startup environment.

The team may include:
- Members from **high-context communication cultures**
- **Neurodivergent individuals**
- Mixed preferences for verbal, non-verbal, and somatic expression

**Goal:**  
Evaluate the local consciousness field ($\Psi$) during a routine team session, identify blockages, and ensure **ethical, safe, and non-coercive interventions**.

## Step 1 – Contextual Calibration Protocol v1.0 (Revised)

### Objective
Calibrate observation to the group’s **own lived reality**, without imposing external norms or predefined behavioral indicators.

- **Duration:** ~45 minutes
- **Principle:** The field defines its own signals.

### Step 1.1 – Introduction (5 min)

**Facilitator statement:**

> “Before we observe anything, our first step is to learn your team’s language of interaction.  
> How does safety, newness, and connection show up *here*?  
> There are no right answers.  
> My job is to learn your signs — not to teach you mine.”

### Step 1.2 – Local Mapping: Open Elicitation (20 min)

The facilitator presents a blank table and asks **open, non-leading questions**.  
All indicators are generated by the team itself.

| Concept | Guiding Question | Examples the Team Might Generate |
|------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **L — Calm / Safety** | “What can we see or hear when someone here feels truly at ease and unguarded?” | “Light humming”, “Taking up more physical space”, “Slower speech rhythm” |
| **S — Spontaneity / Novelty** | “How does an unplanned idea or playful moment show up physically in this team?” | “Tangential doodles”, “Non-sequitur sound effects”, “Whispered side-comments” |
| **I — Interconnectedness** | “What are tiny, observable signs that we’re deeply tuned in — even in disagreement?” | “Synchronized pauses”, “Repeating core words”, “Leaning forward together” |

**Facilitator rule:**
- Write down the team’s **exact phrases**
- Do not suggest, normalize, or correct
- If a concept feels unclear, ask:  
  *“What does the opposite look like here?”*

### Step 1.3 – Baseline Exercise & Consent (15 min)

- **Neutral activity (5 min):**  
  “Discuss your favorite source of natural light in the office.”

- Facilitator practices spotting **only the team-defined indicators**

- **Collective consent check:**  
  > “Given the language we’ve just built together — does it feel safe and accurate to proceed?  
  > Is anything missing or misrepresented?”
