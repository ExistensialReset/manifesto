# DIVINE Field Audit Scenario  
### A Neuro-Inclusive, Culturally-Calibrated Reference Implementation

> **Status:** Annex / Reference Scenario  
> **Scope:** Illustrative, non-normative  
> **Purpose:** Demonstrates how DIVINE field audits can be conducted ethically, inclusively, and without coercive optimization.

---

## Overview

This document presents a **hypothetical field audit scenario** using the DIVINE framework and the Three Core Pillars:

- **L — Calm / Coherence**
- **S — Spontaneity**
- **I — Interconnectedness**

The scenario is designed as a **reference implementation**, not a prescription.  
It prioritizes **pattern recognition over numerical scoring**, and **care before insight**, especially in culturally diverse and neurodivergent contexts.

---

## Context

A small, diverse creative team (5 people) in a startup environment.

The team may include:
- Members from **high-context communication cultures**
- **Neurodivergent individuals**
- Mixed preferences for verbal, non-verbal, and somatic expression

**Goal:**  
Evaluate the local consciousness field ($\Psi$) during a routine team session, identify blockages, and ensure **ethical, safe, and non-coercive interventions**.

---

## Step 1 – Contextual Calibration Protocol v1.0 (Revised)

### Objective
Calibrate observation to the group’s **own lived reality**, without imposing external norms or predefined behavioral indicators.

- **Duration:** ~45 minutes
- **Principle:** The field defines its own signals.

---

### Step 1.1 – Introduction (5 min)

**Facilitator statement:**

> “Before we observe anything, our first step is to learn your team’s language of interaction.  
> How does safety, newness, and connection show up *here*?  
> There are no right answers.  
> My job is to learn your signs — not to teach you mine.”

---

### Step 1.2 – Local Mapping: Open Elicitation (20 min)

The facilitator presents a blank table and asks **open, non-leading questions**.  
All indicators are generated by the team itself.

| Concept | Guiding Question | Examples the Team Might Generate |
|------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| **L — Calm / Safety** | “What can we see or hear when someone here feels truly at ease and unguarded?” | “Light humming”, “Taking up more physical space”, “Slower speech rhythm” |
| **S — Spontaneity / Novelty** | “How does an unplanned idea or playful moment show up physically in this team?” | “Tangential doodles”, “Non-sequitur sound effects”, “Whispered side-comments” |
| **I — Interconnectedness** | “What are tiny, observable signs that we’re deeply tuned in — even in disagreement?” | “Synchronized pauses”, “Repeating core words”, “Leaning forward together” |

**Facilitator rule:**
- Write down the team’s **exact phrases**
- Do not suggest, normalize, or correct
- If a concept feels unclear, ask:  
  *“What does the opposite look like here?”*

---

### Step 1.3 – Baseline Exercise & Consent (15 min)

- **Neutral activity (5 min):**  
  “Discuss your favorite source of natural light in the office.”

- Facilitator practices spotting **only the team-defined indicators**

- **Collective consent check:**  
  > “Given the language we’ve just built together — does it feel safe and accurate to proceed?  
  > Is anything missing or misrepresented?”

---

### Step 1.4 – Template Adjustment (5 min)

The facilitator updates:
/annex/DIVINE-MEASURE-LOG_TEMPLATE.md
Standard descriptors are replaced with the **team’s own indicators** under L, S, and I.

---

## Step 2 – Field Observation & Pattern Identification

Using the calibrated template, the facilitator observes **patterns**, not scores.

| Variable | Team-Specific Proxies Observed | Qualitative Assessment | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------------|------------------------|------|
| **L — Calm** | Slowed speech in 3/5, humming absent | Moderate | Baseline safety present, slightly fragile |
| **S — Spontaneity** | No doodles, no sound effects | Low | Generative space constrained |
| **I — Interconnectedness** | Frequent synchronized pauses, keyword repetition | High | Strong latent attunement |
| **EV — Wisdom** | Long-term morale prioritized over short-term gain | High | |
| **Σ — Grace** | One member quietly passes water to another | Present | Minor but meaningful signal |

### Identified Pattern (Not a Number)

> **“High Interconnectedness, Constrained Spontaneity.”**

The field is coherent and connected, but generativity is limited primarily by low **S**.

---

## Step 3 – Ethical Decision Matrix (Pattern-Based)

### Observation
**Pattern:** High I, Low S

| Condition | Forbidden Action | Ethical, Culturally-Safe Alternative |
|---------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Low S in High-I field | Forced brainstorming, demand for “big ideas” | Offer **optional micro-experiments** |
| Moderate L | Mandatory relaxation or regulation | Offer **ambient support** (e.g. dimmed lighting) |

### Offered Micro-Experiments

1. **Solo Generation (Optional)**  
   “Two minutes to capture a thought in *your* preferred way — sketch, three words, hum, clay. Sharing is optional.”

2. **Dyadic Dialogue (Optional)**  
   “Turn to one person and finish the sentence:  
   *‘A wild guess about our project is…’*”

**Facilitator framing:**

> “We’re noticing strong connection here.  
> To gently open the idea space, we could try one of these — or neither.  
> What feels safe enough to try?”

---

## Step 4 – Psychological Protection Protocol

### Step 4.1 – Immediate Decompression (5 min)

Non-verbal somatic reset:

> “Stand and shake out one limb at a time, starting with the right hand.  
> No need to sync. Focus inward.”

---

### Step 4.2 – Multi-Access Reflection (15 min)

Participants choose **one channel**:

1. Verbal share  
2. Anonymous written card  
3. Silent presence

**Prompts:**
- “What sensation did you notice in yourself?”
- “Did anything feel particularly spacious or tight?”
- “What did you learn about how this team *is together*?”

---

### Step 4.3 – Delayed Pattern Feedback (24+ hours)

Feedback uses **team language**, not scores:

> “We saw many of the ‘synchronized pauses’ you named, while ‘tangential doodles’ stayed quiet.  
> One invitation might be to allow a single tangential element into the next agenda-free moment.”

---

## Outcome & Reflection

### Key Learnings

1. **Calibration is Discovery**  
   Blank-slate mapping prevented cultural bias and revealed I as a core strength.

2. **Patterns Over Points**  
   “High I, Low S” was more actionable than a low $\Psi$ score.

3. **Choice is Safety**  
   Optional formats prevented coercion and supported neurodiversity.

### Net Effect

The team chose dyadic dialogue.  
Playful ideas emerged without fracturing trust.  
Anonymous cards revealed one member felt “seen but wary of breaking harmony.”

---

## Conclusion

This scenario demonstrates how DIVINE audits become **co-created learning spaces** when:

- The field defines its own signals
- Observation precedes intervention
- Care precedes insight

> **DIVINE Principle:**  
> The field must never be optimized faster than it can remain whole.

---

> **Editor’s Note (Architectural):**  
> This scenario intentionally avoids composite $\Psi$ scoring.  
> In high-interconnectedness contexts, premature quantification can collapse trust and reduce generativity — a known failure mode documented in `/guides/HOW_NOT_TO_IMPLEMENT_FLOW.md`.
