## Purpose

This document describes **what NOT to do** when engaging with the DIVINE framework.  
It’s as important to know the boundaries as the tools themselves.  
Violating these guidelines risks **Ψ corruption**, ethical breaches, or harming participants.

---

## 1. Do Not Treat DIVINE as a “Tool for Control” 🛑

- **Never:** Use DIVINE to measure someone to manipulate, coerce, or surveil them.  
- **Never:** Rank or shame participants based on Ψ values.  
- **Remember:** Ψ is a **field-state**, not a score of personal worth.  
- **Instead:** Use observations to **support well-being**, not to enforce compliance.  

**Example:**  
Do not publish “Ψ scores” of colleagues. Instead, reflect on environmental or systemic blocks that reduce Ψ.

---

## 2. Do Not Ignore Consent ✋

- **Informed consent is mandatory** for all participants.  
- **Check understanding:** Participants must know what is being observed and why.  
- **Respect refusal:** If anyone declines, the observation stops immediately.  

**Special Cases:**  
- Minors: Require assent *and* guardian consent.  
- Vulnerable populations: Additional ethical review required.  

---

## 3. Do Not Neglect Boundaries 🚧

- **Your own:** Facilitators must track their own L × S × I to avoid collapse.  
- **Others’ boundaries:** Never push participants to disclose more than they are comfortable with.  

**Tool:** Use the **Vulnerability Gradient** (from PSI-COLLAPSE-RECOVERY) to gauge safe disclosure.

---

## 4. Do Not Over-Personalize or Over-Optimize Yourself 🔄

- DIVINE is **not a self-optimization machine**.  
- Avoid obsessively “raising your Ψ” numerically.  
- **Instead:** Observe patterns, support systemic improvements, and reflect qualitatively.  

**Example:**  
Instead of aiming for a perfect HRV score, notice when your nervous system feels calm or tense and what contexts influence it.

---

## 5. Do Not Ignore Mammonological Influence 💰

- Mammonology = systems that prioritize extraction, competition, or control over life.  
- DIVINE must remain **outside or resistant** to Mammonological manipulation.  

**Warning Signs:**  
- Pressure to monetize Ψ scores  
- Surveillance under the guise of research  
- Incentivizing participants based on “performance”  

---

## 6. Do Not Use DIVINE Alone as Clinical Therapy 🏥

- Ψ collapse may coexist with clinical conditions (depression, PTSD, psychosis).  
- **DIVINE is complementary**, not a replacement for licensed mental health care.  

**Rule:** Always refer participants to professional support when:  
- Suicidal ideation is present  
- Self-care is impossible for >1 week  
- Severe dissociation or psychosis occurs  

---

## 7. Do Not Misrepresent or Oversell DIVINE 📢

- It is a **framework, not a panacea**.  
- It is **hypothesis-driven**, not proven law.  
- Communicate honestly: field observations are **tools for reflection**, not guarantees.  

**Good Practice:**  
- Share learnings and failures publicly.  
- Invite critique and co-creation.  
- Never promise transformation or enlightenment.

---

## 8. Do Not Forget Systemic Ethics 🌱

- Safeguards must be **built into protocols**:  
  - Observer training  
  - Confidentiality measures  
  - Mandatory stop-rules  

- Weekly or session-based check-ins for **ethical integrity**.  

**Tip:** Use a **shared ethics log** for teams facilitating DIVINE observations.

---

## 9. Key Takeaways ✅

- DIVINE is **fragile**: misuse can harm participants and destroy trust.  
- **Ethics first**: If unsure, pause and reflect.  
- Always prioritize **well-being over data**.  
- Remember: **No is always valid**, both from participants and facilitators.  

> “Respect for life and agency comes before any attempt to measure or improve it.”
