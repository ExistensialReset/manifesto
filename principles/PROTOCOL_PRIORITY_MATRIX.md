# PROTOCOL_PRIORITY_MATRIX.md

**Version:** 1.1  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL GUIDELINE  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude & ChatGPT 

**Purpose:** Provide a clear hierarchy when multiple protocols are triggered simultaneously.

---

## 1. PRIORITY ORDER

1. **BASELINE EMERGENCY** – Threats to water, food, shelter, medical care  
   → CRISIS_PROTOCOL takes precedence

2. **HARM TO PERSONS** – Violence, assault, or abuse  
   → HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL takes precedence

3. **SYSTEM INTEGRITY** – Sabotage, axiom drift, critical AI divergence  
   → INFRASTRUCTURE_SABOTAGE or AXIOM_DEFENSE

4. **RESOURCE ALLOCATION** – Conflicts, verification, deadlocks  
   → FLOW_VERIFICATION or REGIONAL_DEADLOCK

5. **NODE WELLBEING** – Slow erosion, mental health, burnout  
   → SLOW_EROSION or SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS

---

## 2. CONFLICT RESOLUTION

* If protocols are same-level:  
  - **BASELINE PRIMACY** decides  
  - **Regional coordination** mediates

* Temporal markers:  
  - Lower-priority protocol may be delayed maximum 30 days unless threat escalates.

---

## 3. EXAMPLES
SCENARIO: 
Infrastructure sabotage during regional deadlock
- Priority 3 vs Priority 4
- Action: Address sabotage first
- If sabotage caused by deadlock → run both protocols in parallel

SCENARIO: Slow erosion + youth harm incident
- Priority 5 vs Priority 2
- Action: Youth harm takes precedence
- Erosion investigation continues in parallel

## 4. NOTES

* All activations logged and reviewed.  
* Temporal and spatial awareness ensures protocols do not starve resources or attention.  
* Integration with BASELINE_EMERGENCY_BYPASS ensures life-critical resources are never delayed.
