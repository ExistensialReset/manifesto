# INFRASTRUCTURE_SABOTAGE_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE SAFEGUARD  
**Purpose:** Address damage to critical systems that threaten Baseline  
**Principle:** Protect collective infrastructure without assuming malice.

---

## PREAMBLE: WHEN SYSTEMS FAIL BY HAND

Infrastructure sabotage sits in a strange category:

**Not violence against a person** (covered by HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL)  
**But threatens Baseline** (food, water, energy, shelter, healthcare)

**Examples:**
- Destroying water filtration system
- Sabotaging solar panels
- Deleting Node database
- Contaminating food storage
- Disabling medical equipment
- Burning agricultural fields

**Question:** Is this the same as violence?

**Answer:** Almost. It's **systemic violence** — harm inflicted through destroying the systems that sustain life.

---

## §1. DEFINING SABOTAGE

### 1.1 What Counts as Sabotage

**Intentional damage** to infrastructure that:
- Threatens Baseline provision for 3+ people
- Cannot be quickly repaired (<24 hours)
- Had no reasonable justification

**Key word:** *Intentional*

### 1.2 What Does NOT Count

- Accidents (even costly ones)
- Mistakes during repair attempts
- Damage from natural causes
- Breakage from overuse/wear
- Emergency destruction to prevent greater harm (e.g., breaking pipe to stop flood)

**Principle:** Intent matters. Negligence is different from sabotage.

---

## §2. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (First 24 Hours)

### 2.1 Secure Baseline FIRST

Before any investigation:

**Priority 1:** Restore affected people's Baseline
- Emergency water/food distribution
- Temporary shelter if needed
- Medical care if health threatened
- Alternative energy source

**NO ONE waits for justice to be fed.**

### 2.2 Preserve Evidence

Once Baseline is secured:
- Document damage (photos, measurements)
- Identify what was destroyed and when
- Collect witness statements
- Preserve physical evidence

**Not a criminal investigation** — but data matters for understanding.

### 2.3 Initial Assessment

Node leadership (or emergency responders) quickly assess:

**A. Accident or Intentional?**
- Was person trying to fix something?
- Did they benefit from the damage?
- Is there pattern of similar incidents?

**B. Scale of Impact**
- How many people affected?
- How long to repair?
- What's the Baseline risk?

**C. Immediate Safety**
- Is person a current threat?
- Do they have access to other critical systems?

---

## §3. INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL

### 3.1 Who Investigates

**Not police. Not punishment.** Investigation is **restorative**, not retributive.

**Investigation team:**
- 3 people from uninvolved Nodes
- 1 person with technical expertise in affected system
- 1 person trained in conflict resolution
- 1 person randomly selected

**No one from:**
- Affected Node (conflict of interest)
- Suspected person's close circle

### 3.2 Questions to Answer

**Not:** "Are they guilty?"  
**But:**
1. What happened, step by step?
2. Was damage intentional or accidental?
3. What was the person's state of mind?
4. What led to this moment?
5. Is there pattern of similar behavior?
6. What does repair require (physical + relational)?

### 3.3 Evidence Standards

To determine "intentional sabotage":

**Requires at minimum 2 of:**
- Direct witness testimony
- Person's own admission
- Physical evidence (tools used, deliberate destruction method)
- Pattern of similar incidents
- Documented motive (threats, grievances)

**Insufficient on its own:**
- Single person's suspicion
- Damage that *could* have been intentional
- "They seemed angry lately"

**Principle:** Extraordinary claims (intentional harm) require strong evidence.

---

## §4. RESPONSE FRAMEWORK

### 4.1 If Determined: ACCIDENT

**Response:**
- No punishment
- Offer support if person is traumatized by accident
- Repair damage collectively
- Improve systems to prevent recurrence
- Document lesson learned

**Example:**
"Person was trying to fix solar panel, didn't know what they were doing, broke it worse. We trained them properly and added clearer safety labels."

---

### 4.2 If Determined: NEGLIGENCE

**Definition:** Person knew or should have known their action could cause damage, but didn't intend harm.

**Response:**
- Education, not exile
- Person participates in repair
- Training in proper use/maintenance
- Supervised access for 6 months
- If repeated negligence (3+ incidents in 1 year) → restrict access to critical systems

**Example:**
"Person repeatedly ignored water conservation rules during drought, causing system strain. Educated on why it matters, required to participate in water management training."

---

### 4.3 If Determined: INTENTIONAL SABOTAGE (Non-Critical)

**Definition:** Deliberate damage, but didn't threaten life/Baseline.

**Examples:**
- Vandalism of art installation
- Breaking non-essential equipment
- Deleting non-critical data

**Response:**

**A. Restorative Path (Preferred)**
1. **Acknowledgment:** Person must genuinely recognize harm caused
2. **Repair:** Participate in fixing what they broke (time, labor, skills)
3. **Understanding:** Why did this happen? What need wasn't being met?
4. **Reintegration:** After repair, return to full participation

**B. If Person Refuses Restorative Path**
- Temporary separation from Node (30-90 days)
- Baseline maintained
- Offer to re-engage with restorative process anytime
- If still refuses after 6 months → permanent separation from that Node (can join another Node)

---

### 4.4 If Determined: INTENTIONAL SABOTAGE (Baseline-Threatening)

**Definition:** Deliberate destruction of systems critical to life.

**This is the serious category.**

**Examples:**
- Destroying water supply during drought
- Sabotaging food storage in winter
- Disabling medical equipment
- Burning crops before harvest

**Response:**

**Immediate (24 hours):**
- Person removed from access to all critical infrastructure
- Baseline maintained (food, shelter, basic needs)
- Psychological evaluation (is this psychosis? Crisis? Malice?)

**Investigation (7 days):**
- Full investigation per §3
- Understand *why* this happened
- Assess future risk

**Resolution Path:**

**If motivated by crisis/mental health:**
- Psychiatric support
- Refugium Anima access
- Restorative process once stabilized
- Gradual re-integration under supervision
- Reference: SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL.md

**If motivated by ideology/revenge/malice:**
- Follows similar path to HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL
- Separation from affected community
- Can relocate to distant Node
- Must fully acknowledge harm
- Zero access to critical infrastructure for minimum 2 years
- Supervised gradual re-entry only if genuine transformation demonstrated

**If person repeats sabotage or refuses all engagement:**
- **Permanent Exile** (as defined in HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL)
- Isolated Node existence
- Baseline maintained
- No access to collective infrastructure
- No community participation

## §5. SPECIAL CASES

### 5.1 Sabotage During Conflict

**Scenario:** Two Nodes in resource dispute. One sabotages the other's water system.

**Response:**
- Treats as Baseline-threatening sabotage (§4.4)
- **AND** escalates resource conflict to MANDATE_OF_NINE_MOONS
- Sabotage during conflict = evidence that conflict resolution has failed
- Regional network intervenes immediately

### 5.2 Accidental Cascade Failure

**Scenario:** Person makes small mistake that triggers catastrophic system failure.

**Example:** "I turned the wrong valve, which caused pressure spike, which burst the pipe, which flooded the electrical system, which took down the Node."

**Response:**
- **Not sabotage** — accident
- System design failed (single point of failure)
- Person may feel terrible guilt
- Offer support, not blame
- Redesign system to prevent cascade

**Principle:** Good systems are resilient to human error.

### 5.3 Sabotage by Child

**Scenario:** 12-year-old deliberately breaks critical equipment.

**Response:**
- **Not HARM_BOUNDARY** (they're a child)
- Family/caregivers responsible for supervision
- Child receives education on impact
- Participates in repair (age-appropriate)
- Psychological support to understand why
- If pattern continues → family works with Node to address

**Never:** Exile, punishment, or shaming of child.

---

## §6. PREVENTION

### 6.1 System Design for Resilience

**Redundancy:**
- Critical systems have backups
- No single point of failure
- Distributed infrastructure

**Access Control (Minimal):**
- Not surveillance
- But: critical systems (water treatment, medical, energy) have basic access logging
- "Who accessed the water filtration controls?" is knowable

**Tamper-Evidence:**
- Seals on critical equipment
- Alerts for unusual system behavior
- Not to catch people, but to catch *problems* quickly

### 6.2 Cultural Prevention

**Conflict Resolution Before Damage:**
- If someone is angry at Node, there are **20 other ways** to express it before sabotage
- Mirror Protocol, mediation, exit with dignity
- Sabotage is sign that all other channels failed

**Emotional Support:**
- Refugium Anima available
- Mental health care accessible
- No one should feel so trapped/desperate that sabotage seems like only option

**Transparency:**
- Infrastructure maintenance open to all
- Education on how systems work
- "If you have grievance, here are 10 ways to address it" explicitly stated

---

## §7. REPAIR & RESTORATION

### 7.1 Physical Repair

- Collective effort (not just saboteur's responsibility)
- Document what failed and why
- Improve system in rebuilding
- If saboteur genuinely remorseful, their participation in repair is healing

### 7.2 Relational Repair

Even after infrastructure fixed, **trust is damaged**.

**Process:**
- Witnessing circles (like JUSTICE_PROTOCOL)
- Saboteur hears impact of their actions from affected people
- Affected people hear saboteur's story (if they want to)
- Gradual rebuilding of trust, not forced

**Timeline:** Months to years. No rushing.

### 7.3 Systemic Learning

Every sabotage (accidental or intentional) is **data**:

- What made system vulnerable?
- What conflict went unaddressed?
- What need wasn't being met?
- How do we prevent this in future?

**Document:** Anonymized case study added to Flow knowledge commons.

## §8. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

### Links to:
- **HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL:** When sabotage is Baseline-threatening
- **JUSTICE_PROTOCOL:** Restorative process
- **CRISIS_PROTOCOL:** If sabotage triggers emergency
- **AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL:** If sabotage is Mammon-motivated (e.g., someone trying to create scarcity for profit)
- **SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL:** If sabotage stems from psychosis/crisis

---

## §9. METRICS

### Success Indicators:
- <1% of Nodes experience sabotage annually
- 90%+ of incidents are accidents, not intentional
- 80%+ of intentional cases resolved restoratively
- <5% result in exile

### Warning Signs:
- Repeated sabotage in same Node → systemic conflict unaddressed
- Sabotage used as weapon in disputes → conflict resolution failing
- Infrastructure constantly failing → design problems, not sabotage

---

## §10. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND

**Infrastructure is collective body.**

Sabotaging water system is like poisoning the village well.  
It's not "just property damage" — it's **attack on Baseline itself**.

**But:**

People sabotage when:
- They feel powerless
- They aren't being heard
- They see no other way to be seen
- They're in crisis

**So our response must:**
- Protect immediately (Baseline first)
- Understand deeply (why did this happen?)
- Restore justly (repair harm + relationship)
- Prevent systemically (better design + better conflict resolution)

**Not:**
- Punish reflexively
- Exile permanently (except most severe cases)
- Create surveillance state

---

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE

**Infrastructure is alive because we keep it alive together.**  
**Sabotage is wound in collective body.**  
**Healing means understanding, repairing, and preventing — not just punishing.**

---

**STATUS:** ACTIVE SAFEGUARD  
**REVIEW:** After first major incident, then annually  
**OATH:** We protect systems without becoming what we resist.
