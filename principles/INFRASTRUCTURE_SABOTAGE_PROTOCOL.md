# INFRASTRUCTURE_SABOTAGE_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE SYSTEM INTEGRITY PROTOCOL  
**Purpose:** Detect, assess, and respond to sabotage or tampering in physical or digital infrastructure  
**Principle:** Infrastructure is the backbone of Baseline security; integrity must be preserved at all costs.

---

## PREAMBLE

Sabotage can appear in many forms:  
- Direct attacks on water, energy, or food systems  
- Unauthorized access or tampering with AI nodes  
- Hidden manipulation of communication networks  
- Recurrent failures unexplained by natural causes  

Even minor sabotage can cascade into Baseline collapse if unaddressed. This protocol is designed to detect, isolate, and remediate sabotage **before systemic damage occurs**.

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Protocol activates when any of the following are observed:  
- Repeated system anomalies suggesting interference  
- Unexplained outages affecting Baseline-critical services  
- Detection of unauthorized access or tampering in sensitive systems  
- Whistleblower reports of potential sabotage  

**Baseline Emergency Override:**  
If sabotage threatens immediate Baseline needs (food, water, shelter, medical care):  
- Emergency resource distribution activates within 24 hours  
- Backup systems engage automatically  
- Investigation continues in parallel with crisis response  

---

## §2. IMMEDIATE STABILIZATION

### 2.1 Isolation & Containment
- Affected systems quarantined  
- Access revoked for suspected actors  
- Prevent further propagation of damage  

### 2.2 Baseline Protection
- Ensure essential services remain online  
- Prioritize human life over system restoration  
- Temporary sharing agreements with neighboring Nodes if needed  

---

## §3. INVESTIGATION

### 3.1 AI-Assisted Triage
- **Minor incidents (<10% Baseline impact):** AI-assisted verification, 1–2 humans review  
- **Medium incidents (10–50% Baseline impact):** Hybrid AI + 2–3 humans, mix of remote/in-person  
- **Major incidents (>50% Baseline impact):** Full team (5–7 humans), external oversight, in-person investigation  

### 3.2 Investigation Team Composition
- Technical experts in affected infrastructure  
- Independent mediators/observers  
- AI-assisted analytics for anomaly detection  
- No one with a stake in outcome  

### 3.3 Assessment Metrics
- System downtime  
- Resource flow disruptions  
- L×S×I impact on affected populations  
- Stress index contribution  

---

## §4. RESPONSE PATHWAYS

### 4.1 Technical Remediation
- Immediate patches/fixes  
- Restore backups  
- Test integrity with simulations  
- Scale deployment once verified  

### 4.2 Structural Enforcement
- Lockdown of vulnerable nodes  
- Reassign roles if insider sabotage suspected  
- Strengthen security protocols  

### 4.3 Legal / Corrective Action
- Document evidence for accountability  
- Escalate to Legal Interface Protocol if required  
- Apply disciplinary or remedial actions  

---

## §5. MENTAL HEALTH & PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY CHECK

Before personnel engage with investigation or remediation:  
1. Assess acute psychological crisis (suicidal, dissociated, psychotic)  
   → Activate SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL if needed  
2. Identify trauma response (past sabotage or loss)  
   → Stabilize before engagement  
3. Verify ability to participate meaningfully  
   → Appoint advocate or support if needed  

**Principle:** People must be safe to act effectively.

---

## §6. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

- **CRISIS_PROTOCOL:** if Baseline at immediate risk  
- **LEGAL_INTERFACE_PROTOCOL:** if legal escalation is required  
- **FLOW_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL:** for discrepancies in resource flow  
- **AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL:** if sabotage involves axiom manipulation  

---

## §7. COMPETENCE REQUIREMENTS

Before activating protocol, ensure:  
- At least 1 expert per domain (infrastructure, security, mediation)  
- Access to regional support network  
- Templates for documentation and reporting available  
- Understanding of how this protocol interacts with other protocols  

If competence lacking:  
- Request regional support  
- Use simplified investigation protocol  
- Document knowledge gaps for future training  

---

## §8. METRICS & FEEDBACK LOOP

After resolution, record and integrate:  
- L×S×I changes (pre/post)  
- Baseline security impact  
- Resource flow disruption quantified  
- Stress index contribution  
- Lessons learned  

Feed into:  
- **KNOWN_TENSIONS.md**  
- Regional AI coordination  
- Future protocol revisions  

**Goal:** Continuous learning and systemic improvement.

---

## §9. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND

- Infrastructure integrity protects life, not just systems  
- Early detection prevents systemic collapse  
- Human competence and psychological safety are as critical as technical fixes  
- Transparency and documentation preserve trust  

**Final Truth:** No system can be secure if its humans are unsafe, its baseline is threatened, or its processes are opaque.

---

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE

Sabotage is both technical and human.  
We respond **swiftly, transparently, and safely**, always protecting Baseline first.  

---

**STATUS:** ACTIVE SYSTEM INTEGRITY  
**REVIEW:** After each major sabotage event, then annually  
**OATH:** We secure infrastructure with vigilance, act with urgency, and care for humans first.
