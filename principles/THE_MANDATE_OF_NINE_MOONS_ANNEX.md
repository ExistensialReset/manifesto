- Explicitly define boundaries, safeguards, and failure modes  
- Protect individuals — especially children — from symbolic, moral, or procedural harm

# ANNEX A  
## INTERPRETIVE BOUNDARIES & NON-APPLICABILITY

### A.1 What This Protocol Is

The Mandate of Nine Moons is:

- A **collective conflict containment and direction protocol**
- Applicable **only** at systemic or inter-community levels
- Designed to address **irreducible deadlock** after all other resolution pathways have failed
- Oriented toward **Baseline protection**, not moral judgment

### A.2 What This Protocol Is Not

The Mandate is explicitly **not**:

- A legal court or substitute for judicial process  
- A democratic mechanism or voting system  
- A religious ritual, spiritual authority, or metaphysical practice  
- A moral tribunal assigning blame, guilt, innocence, or virtue  
- A mechanism for deciding individual fate, punishment, or responsibility  
- A process that determines outcomes affecting individual bodies, liberty, or rights  

Any attempt to apply this protocol to:

- Criminal responsibility  
- Individual persons  
- Bodily autonomy  
- Punitive or coercive outcomes  

…constitutes **immediate invalidation** of the Mandate.

### A.3 Prohibition of Symbolic Attribution

No symbolic, metaphoric, or narrative attribution may be assigned to:

- Council Bearers  
- The Child referenced in Annex B  
- The Dice  
- The outcome itself  

The Mandate produces **direction**, not meaning.  
Narrativization beyond the written outcome is prohibited.

# ANNEX B  
## CHILD SAFEGUARD CLARIFICATION

This annex exists to ensure absolute protection of children from harm, responsibility, symbolism, or psychological burden.

### B.1 Fundamental Principle

Under no circumstances may a child:

- Bear responsibility for a decision  
- Be framed as an agent of fate, choice, or consequence  
- Be associated with moral, symbolic, or narrative meaning  
- Be impacted personally by the outcome of the Mandate  

The child is **never** a decision-maker.  
The system remains fully accountable at all times.

### B.2 The Role of the Child (Final Contingency Only)

If — and only if — a Testimony of Impotence is issued under §4 of the Mandate:

- The child’s presence serves solely as a **systemic veto threshold**
- The operative ethical act is the **caregivers’ consent or refusal**
- The child performs no conscious act of decision or intention
- The system is designed such that the **most ethical outcome is that the casting never occurs**

### B.3 The Veto as the True Instrument

The caregivers’ veto is the primary safeguard.

If consent is withheld:

- The dice is not cast
- The ritual ends immediately
- The outcome defaults permanently to Structured Coexistence
- No appeal, repetition, or alternative mechanism is permitted

A refusal is not a failure.  
It is recognized as the **highest confirmation of systemic integrity**.

### B.4 Anonymity, Aftercare, and Non-Recording

- No names, images, identifiers, or records of the child or family are kept  
- No public reference may be made  
- The child and family return immediately to ordinary life  
- Support is provided without narrative framing or recognition  

Any breach of anonymity permanently disqualifies the protocol instance.

# ANNEX C  
## FAILURE MODES, MISUSE SCENARIOS & TERMINATION CONDITIONS

### C.1 Known Failure Modes

The Mandate must not be invoked under the following conditions:

- As a shortcut around political difficulty  
- To delay accountability or avoid responsibility  
- In emotionally charged situations without full exhaustion of prior protocols  
- Where power asymmetry prevents genuine consent  
- Where outcomes would materially harm identifiable individuals  

Invocation under these conditions constitutes misuse.

### C.2 Indicators of Misuse or Drift

Immediate suspension is required if any of the following occur:

- Media spectacle or performative framing  
- Narrative myth-making around participants or outcomes  
- Pressure placed on caregivers, Council Bearers, or communities  
- Attempts to accelerate or abbreviate the nine-moon timeline  
- Attempts to replicate or ritualize the dice procedure outside its defined scope  

### C.3 Safeguard Breach Response

If any safeguard is violated:

1. The Mandate instance is terminated
2. Outcomes are voided
3. Structured Coexistence becomes the binding default
4. A public record of termination reason is issued (without personal detail)
5. No re-invocation is permitted for the same conflict

### C.4 One-Time Nature & Non-Scalability

- Each Mandate is unique and non-repeatable
- The protocol may not be scaled, automated, franchised, or commodified
- AI systems may support simulation and verification only — never authority
- Any attempt to standardize outcomes invalidates the protocol’s legitimacy

## FINAL SAFEGUARD STATEMENT

The Mandate of Nine Moons is designed to be difficult to invoke, slow to unfold, and easy to stop.

If it cannot protect the most vulnerable from symbolic or procedural harm,  
then it must not proceed.

A living system proves its ethics not by reaching decisions —  
but by knowing when to refuse to make them.
