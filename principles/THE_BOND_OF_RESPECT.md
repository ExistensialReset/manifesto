# THE_BOND_OF_RESPECT.md

**Status:** Active Contract for Social and Digital Sovereignty  
**Core Principle:** Your freedom is my security. We own our attention, our data, and our relationships.

---

## 1. Preamble: Sovereignty in Community
Existential sovereignty means that no human owns another’s time, thoughts, or future. Respect is the baseline we grant one another.

---

## 2. The Social Baseline

### 2.1 Radical Inclusion (The Canary Rule)
We design for the most sensitive. If the system works for a trauma survivor, it works for everyone.

### 2.2 Participation Without Coercion
Your right to exist is not tied to your social performance or "usefulness."

### 2.3 Rotation of Power
Roles rotate to prevent "charismatic capital" from hardening into oppression. 
* **Spjuver-Twist:** To keep it playful, next roles can be chosen via a "Lottery of Wisdom"—answering a creative question from nature (e.g., "How would an oak tree handle this conflict?") to guide the transition.

## 3. Digital Sovereignty and Data Ethics

### 3.1 Cognitive Ownership
Your attention is your private property. We treat "attention-theft" as a violation of personal sovereignty.
This means:
- No algorithmic manipulation of your focus
- No design patterns that exploit psychological vulnerabilities
- No shame for choosing where you direct your awareness

### 3.2 The Echo Chamber Breaker
The system shall flag if a Circle becomes too homogeneous in thought and suggest inviting "wild voices"—perspectives from other circles or non-human viewpoints via AI reflection.

### 3.3 Transparency & Human-Readable Logic
Logic should not only be open source but explained in plain language (Flow-Logs). Anyone can ask: "Why did the system suggest this?" and receive a clear, honest answer.

## 4. Metrics of Respect
* **Trust Index:** Do people feel safe enough to be **Spontaneous (S)**?
* **Decisional Agency:** What percentage of decisions affecting you were shaped by you?
* **Diversity of Being:** Ensuring multiple ways of thinking coexist without clashing with the Baseline.

**VERSION:** 1.3 (Echo-Breaker Update)
