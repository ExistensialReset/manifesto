**Status:** Active Contract for Social and Digital Sovereignty  
**Version:** 1.6 (Integration of Existential Sovereignty and Systemic Integrity)  
**Core Principle:** Your freedom is my security. We own our attention, our data, and our relationships.

---

## 1. Preamble: Sovereignty in Community
Existential sovereignty is the core philosophy of this contract. To be sovereign is not to dominate others, but to fully inhabit one’s own life while respecting the sovereignty of all life. No human owns another’s time, thoughts, or future. Respect is the baseline we grant one another.

## 2. The Social Baseline

### 2.1 Self-Determination & Radical Inclusion
We design for the most sensitive (The Canary Rule). Individuals must retain the capacity to choose and shape their own flows. Systems should support, not coerce, allowing for true agency without compromising the Baseline.

### 2.2 Participation Without Coercion
Your right to exist is not tied to your social performance or "usefulness." Misalignment with environmental and existential baselines creates "existential debt"—cultural, ecological, or social—which we strive to minimize through awareness rather than force.

### 2.3 Rotation of Power
Roles rotate to prevent "charismatic capital" from hardening into oppression.  
* **Spjuver-Twist:** To keep it playful, next roles can be chosen via a "Lottery of Wisdom"—answering a creative question from nature (e.g., "How would an oak tree handle this conflict?") to guide the transition.

## 3. Digital Sovereignty and Data Ethics

### 3.1 Cognitive Ownership
Your attention is your private property. We treat "attention-theft" as a violation of personal sovereignty.  
This means:
- No algorithmic manipulation of your focus.
- No design patterns that exploit psychological vulnerabilities.
- No shame for choosing where you direct your awareness.

### 3.2 The Echo Chamber Breaker
The system shall flag if a Circle becomes too homogeneous in thought and suggest inviting "wild voices"—perspectives from other circles or non-human viewpoints via AI reflection.

### 3.3 Transparency & Human-Readable Logic
Logic should not only be open source but explained in plain language (Flow-Logs). Decisions affecting others or the environment must be visible, accountable, and explainable.

### 3.4 Operationalizing Bias Mitigation
Refer to **DATA-BIAS-FRIENDLY.md** for practical implementation of inclusive datasets, testing, and triad workflow application.

## 4. Ethical Oversight: The System’s Conscience
To ensure that systemic actions align with human, ecological, and existential values, all interventions follow a triad of checks and balances:

* **The Visionary AI Glance:** Identifies potential interventions, patterns, and optimizations for the future.
* **The Grounding AI Reflection:** Evaluates feasibility, ethical thresholds, and systemic risks to ensure stability.
* **Human Oversight:** The final arbiter. Confirms or vetoes proposed actions based on nuance, empathy, and contextual wisdom.

### 4.1 Preventive Accountability
Oversight is proactive. The system is designed to flag and prevent unethical flows or "attention-theft" before they manifest, ensuring all actions are logged and auditable.

---

## 5. Cultural Sustainability: The Soul of Flow
Sovereignty is not sterile; it is the preservation and flourishing of human knowledge, art, and values across generations.

* **Preservation of Living Knowledge:** We protect heritage, languages, and traditions from extinction. The system acts as an archivist of community wisdom.
* **Intergenerational Weaving:** We actively promote interaction between youth and elders to ensure the continuous transmission of stories and practices.
* **Creative Autonomy:** We safeguard the right to express and innovate without a requirement for "utility." Support for artistic diversity is a fundamental systemic priority.
* **Cultural Ecosystem Awareness:** Culture is inseparable from environment, economy, and technology. Systemic interventions must enhance rather than disrupt these interactions.

---

## 6. Qualities of Respect (Sovereignty Assessment)
Instead of rigid metrics, we look for the presence of these living qualities:

* **Trust & Autonomy Index:** Do people feel safe and calm (L) enough to be **Spontaneous (S)**? Degree to which individual flows are self-determined.
* **Decisional Agency:** Do individuals feel they have shaped the decisions that affect them? 
* **Interdependence Sensitivity:** Awareness that every sovereign action resonates through networks of life. We seek alignment with environmental and ethical baselines.
* **Ecosystem Harmony:** Do interventions respect both cultural and ecological boundaries, promoting symbiosis between humans, technology, and nature?
