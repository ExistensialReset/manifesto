**Status:** Active Contract for Social and Digital Sovereignty  
**Core Principle:** Your freedom is my security. We own our attention, our data, and our relationships.

---

## 1. Preamble: Sovereignty in Community
Existential sovereignty means that no human owns another’s time, thoughts, or future. When we erase the systems of debt and exploitation, we do not leave a vacuum; we create a space for **Innate Empathy (I)**. 

Respect is not something to be earned—it is the baseline we grant one another to make Flow possible.

> "Freedom without responsibility is chaos; responsibility without freedom is oppression."

## 2. The Social Baseline
Every member of a Circle has the right to a social environment that protects their **Calm (L)**.

### 2.1 Radical Inclusion (The Canary Rule)
We design for the most sensitive. If the system works for a neurodivergent person or a trauma survivor, it works for everyone. We do not ask the individual to "fix" themselves; we adjust the environment to hold them.

### 2.2 Participation Without Coercion
No one shall be forced into social contexts to access the Baseline. Your right to exist, eat, and be housed is not tied to your social performance, extroversion, or "usefulness."

### 2.3 Rotation of Power
Flow knows no permanent leaders. Roles rotate to prevent "charismatic capital" from hardening into structural oppression. Power is a temporary function, never an identity.

## 3. Digital Sovereignty and Data Ethics
Data is not a commodity; it is an extension of our cognition and our lived experience.

### 3.1 Cognitive Ownership
Your attention is your private property. No algorithms shall be designed to "capture," steer, or monetize your focus. We treat "attention-theft" as a violation of personal sovereignty.

### 3.2 Consent as Breath
Digital consent is not a one-time checkbox; it is an ongoing dialogue. You have the right to withdraw your data and be "forgotten" at any moment without losing access to essential services.

### 3.3 Transparency & Human-Readable Logic
All systems that make logistical decisions must be open and auditable. 
* **Human-Readable Kognition:** Logic should not only be open source but explained in plain language (Flow-Logs). Anyone should be able to ask: "Why did the system suggest this?" and receive a clear, honest answer.
* **Evolutionary Feedback:** If you have a better idea for how the system should "think" or prioritize, the network provides a path for your suggestion to be integrated, regardless of your technical skill.

## 4. Metrics of Respect
We do not measure performance; we measure relational health:
* **Trust Index:** Do people feel safe enough to be **Spontaneous (S)**?
* **Decisional Agency:** What percentage of decisions affecting you were shaped by you?
* **Diversity of Being:** How many different ways of thinking and living coexist in our Circle without clashing with the Baseline?
