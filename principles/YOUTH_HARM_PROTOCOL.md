# YOUTH_HARM_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE SAFEGUARD  
**Purpose:** Address serious harm caused by individuals under 18  
**Principle:** Children are developing humans. Protection of victims AND developmental needs of youth both matter.

---

## PREAMBLE: THE IMPOSSIBLE TENSION

When a child causes serious harm, we face a brutal dilemma:

**Victim needs:**
- Safety
- Justice
- Healing
- To never see the person who harmed them again

**Young person needs:**
- Developmental support
- Chance to grow beyond their actions
- Not to be thrown away at 14
- Accountability that doesn't destroy future

**Both are true. Both matter. Both are hard.**

This protocol attempts to hold both.

---

## §1. SCOPE & DEFINITIONS

### 1.1 Who This Covers

**Age range:** 12-17 years old

**Below 12:**
- Harm is addressed through family/caregiver support
- Focus entirely on child's needs (therapy, assessment)
- Victim protection maintained
- No exile, no separation beyond immediate safety

**Above 18:**
- Adult protocols apply (HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL)

**Special case: 17 years, 11 months:**
- Still falls under this protocol
- Transition planning begins for adult accountability at 18

### 1.2 Types of Harm Covered

**This protocol applies to:**
- Physical violence causing injury
- Sexual harm/assault
- Severe psychological abuse (sustained, intentional)
- Arson or destruction threatening life
- Use of weapons

**This protocol does NOT apply to:**
- Minor conflicts (handled by caregivers/community)
- Accidents
- Single instances of age-appropriate misbehavior
- Property damage (handled separately)

---

## §2. IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (First 48 Hours)

### 2.1 Protect the Victim FIRST

**Non-negotiable:**
- Victim's safety is priority #1
- Immediate separation from young person
- Victim remains in their home/community
- Support activated immediately

**Same as adult protocols:** Victim never moves. Young person does.

### 2.2 Secure the Young Person

**Not punishment. Safety.**

Young person is:
- Removed from victim's presence
- Placed with trusted caregivers (not strangers)
- Ensured Baseline (food, shelter, care)
- **Not put in cage** (no juvenile detention equivalent in Flow)

**Options for placement:**
- Different Node with family/community willing to supervise
- Specialized care facility (if such exists in Flow)
- Refugium with trained youth support staff

### 2.3 Initial Assessment

Within 48 hours:

**Psychological evaluation:**
- Is this psychosis, crisis, trauma response?
- Developmental stage assessment
- Risk level determination

**Context investigation:**
- What led to this?
- Is there history of being harmed themselves?
- Family dynamics?
- Any previous incidents?

**Not to excuse harm** — to understand it.

---

## §3. INVESTIGATION & DETERMINATION

### 3.1 Who Investigates

**Youth Harm Response Team:**
- 1 child psychologist/developmental specialist
- 1 trauma-informed mediator
- 1 youth advocate (represents young person's interests)
- 1 victim advocate (represents victim's interests)
- 2 community members (randomly selected, trained)

**Timeline:** 14 days for full investigation

### 3.2 Questions to Answer

**Not:** "Are they guilty?" (harm is typically clear)  
**But:**

1. What exactly happened?
2. Was this isolated or pattern?
3. What is young person's developmental capacity?
4. What trauma/circumstances contributed?
5. What does victim need to heal?
6. What does young person need to not repeat this?
7. Can safety be ensured?

### 3.3 Determination Categories

**Level 1: Reactive Harm (Single Crisis Event)**
- Out of character
- Clear precipitating trauma/crisis
- Genuine remorse
- No prior pattern
- Low risk of recurrence

**Level 2: Pattern Harm (Repeated Over Time)**
- Multiple incidents
- Escalating severity
- Some awareness but continued behavior
- Moderate risk of recurrence

**Level 3: Predatory Harm (Calculated/Targeted)**
- Deliberate planning
- Lack of remorse
- Enjoyment of others' suffering
- High risk of recurrence

**Critical:** Level doesn't determine worth. It determines intervention intensity.

---

## §4. INTERVENTION PATHWAYS

### 4.1 Level 1: Intensive Support + Supervised Reintegration

**Timeline:** 6-18 months

**Components:**

**Therapeutic:**
- Weekly therapy (trauma-informed)
- Family therapy (if family involved)
- Skill-building (emotional regulation, empathy)
- Address underlying trauma/needs

**Accountability:**
- Restorative justice process (when/if victim willing)
- Written acknowledgment of harm
- Amends (age-appropriate)

**Supervision:**
- Lives in different Node (away from victim)
- Regular check-ins with youth support team
- Monitored progress
- Graduated return to autonomy

**Reintegration (if progress clear):**
- After 12-18 months, assessment
- Victim consulted (but victim's "no" is not absolute for Level 1)
- Gradual return to fuller community participation
- **Never** contact with victim without victim's explicit ongoing consent

---

### 4.2 Level 2: Long-Term Separation + Transformation Work

**Timeline:** 2-5 years (potentially until age 18+)

**Components:**

**Residential:**
- Lives in specialized Node for youth needing intensive support
- Not prison, not punishment — but **structured environment**
- Education continues
- Baseline maintained

**Therapeutic:**
- Intensive therapy (multiple times per week)
- Trauma processing
- Behavioral intervention
- Family work (if appropriate)

**Accountability:**
- Full acknowledgment required (may take years)
- Restorative process when/if ready
- Ongoing assessment of risk

**Education:**
- Continues schooling
- Life skills
- Vocational training
- Preparation for adulthood

**Transition:**
- At 18, re-assessment
- If transformation demonstrated: gradual community reintegration
- If not: continues in adult protocols
- Victim always protected regardless

---

### 4.3 Level 3: Protected Isolation + Intensive Intervention

**Timeline:** Until demonstrated safety (minimum 3 years, often longer)

**For whom:** Youth who pose ongoing danger to others

**Components:**

**Living situation:**
- Highly structured, supportive environment
- Very limited contact with other youth
- Not solitary (has staff, activities) but **protected separation**
- Baseline fully maintained

**Therapeutic:**
- Most intensive intervention available
- Neuropsychological assessment
- Possible medication (if appropriate)
- Long-term trauma work

**Education:**
- Individualized (may be one-on-one)
- Adapted to needs/capacity

**Reality:**
- Some youth may never be safe in general community
- At 18, transitions to adult protocols
- May need lifelong supported/monitored living
- **This is tragic. But it's real.**

**Honesty:** We don't pretend all children can be "fixed." We commit to trying while protecting others.

---

## §5. VICTIM'S ABSOLUTE RIGHTS

### 5.1 Non-Negotiable Protections

**Regardless of young person's age or circumstances:**

1. **No Contact:** Victim never has to see/speak to young person again
2. **Safety:** Victim's location protected, young person kept away
3. **No Forced Forgiveness:** Victim never pressured to "give them another chance"
4. **Veto Power:** Even if community wants reintegration, victim's "no" prevents it in their Node
5. **Lifelong Protection:** Even after young person turns 18, protection continues

### 5.2 Victim Support

- Therapy/counseling
- Community support
- Refugium access
- Relocation assistance (if they want to move)
- Ongoing safety planning

**Victim's healing is not dependent on young person's transformation.**

---

## §6. SPECIAL CASES

### 6.1 Youth-on-Youth Sexual Harm

**Extremely delicate.**

**When both are minors:**
- Both may need support
- Both may have trauma
- Power dynamics assessed carefully
- Age gap matters (14 harming 6 is very different from 16 and 15)

**Response:**
- Victim's safety first (always)
- Young person who harmed: specialized assessment
- Education component (many youth lack healthy sexuality education)
- Therapeutic intervention
- Separation maintained
- Family involvement (carefully)

**Critical:** This is **not** "boys will be boys" or minimization. It's recognition that youth sexuality is complex and harm still requires accountability.

### 6.2 Harm Caused During Psychosis

**Scenario:** 15-year-old experiencing first psychotic break harms someone.

**Response:**
- Medical intervention immediately
- Not "youth harm" primarily — this is mental health crisis
- Follows SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL guidance
- Victim still protected
- Young person receives psychiatric care
- Re-assessment once stabilized

**If harm was result of untreated/unknown psychosis:**
- Focus on treatment, not punishment
- Supervised care
- Medication/therapy as needed
- Gradual reintegration as health stabilizes

**If harm persists even with treatment:**
- More intensive intervention needed
- May require long-term specialized care

### 6.3 Young Person in Denial

**Scenario:** Clear evidence of harm, but young person denies it.

**Response:**
- Doesn't change victim's protection
- Intervention proceeds anyway
- Denial may be developmental (brain not ready to face it)
- Or may be manipulation
- Assessment determines which

**Approach:**
- Don't force confession initially
- Therapeutic work on denial itself
- Over time, most youth develop capacity to acknowledge
- If never acknowledges: affects reintegration timeline (extends it)

---

## §7. FAMILY/CAREGIVER ROLE

### 7.1 When Family is Supportive

**Family is partner in intervention:**
- Participates in therapy
- Helps with accountability
- Supports reintegration
- Monitors progress

**Family responsibilities:**
- Ensure supervision as required
- Attend all meetings/check-ins
- Support victim protection
- Work with youth support team

### 7.2 When Family is Part of Problem

**If family:**
- Enabled harm
- Was abusive to young person
- Minimizes/denies harm
- Refuses to participate

**Response:**
- Young person may need removal from family
- Family receives intervention/education (if willing)
- Alternative caregivers found
- Long-term planning for young person's support network

**Goal:** Young person needs *healthy* support, not just any support.

### 7.3 When Family is Also Victims

**Scenario:** Young person harmed family member.

**Complexity:** Family must protect victim AND support young person.

**Response:**
- Family gets support navigating this
- Separation within family (victim and young person in different spaces)
- External supervision
- Family therapy (carefully structured)
- Recognition that this tears families apart
- No easy answers

---

## §8. TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD

### 8.1 The 18th Birthday Question

**What happens when young person under this protocol turns 18?**

**Assessment at 17.5 years:**
- Review all progress
- Risk evaluation
- Victim consultation
- Determine adult pathway

**Options:**

**A. Successful Transformation**
- Demonstrated accountability
- Years of therapeutic work
- No incidents
- Victim's safety maintained
→ Gradual transition to general community (with continued support)

**B. Ongoing Risk**
- Continued concerning behavior
- Insufficient progress
- Victim safety still at risk
→ Transitions to adult HARM_BOUNDARY protocols (exile/isolation as needed)

**C. Uncertain**
- Some progress, but not clear
→ Extended supervised transition (6-12 months of adult monitoring before full independence)

### 8.2 Young Person's Record

**Question:** Does this follow them forever?

**Answer:**

**Within Flow:**
- Communities they join must be informed (safety)
- But framed as "this person harmed someone and has done X years of work to address it"
- Not public scarlet letter
- Focus on transformation, not permanent condemnation

**Outside Flow:**
- No equivalent of "criminal record" in Flow
- If person leaves Flow, their information doesn't follow
- But Flow communities can choose not to accept someone with undisclosed violent history

**Balance:** Safety vs. redemption. No easy answer.

---

## §9. PREVENTION

### 9.1 Developmental Education

**All youth in Flow receive:**
- Consent education (age-appropriate, ongoing)
- Conflict resolution skills
- Emotional regulation training
- Healthy relationship modeling
- Body autonomy education

**Goal:** Prevent harm before it happens.

### 9.2 Early Intervention

**Warning signs:**
- Hurting animals
- Bullying escalation
- Violent ideation
- Lack of empathy
- Prior smaller incidents

**Response:**
- Therapeutic support immediately
- Family involvement
- Skill-building
- Monitoring

**Not punishment** — early help.

### 9.3 Trauma-Informed Care

**Recognition:** Most youth who harm have been harmed.

**Approach:**
- Address trauma in all youth
- Refugium available
- Mental health support normalized
- Reduce shame around seeking help

**Doesn't excuse harm** — but may prevent it.

---

## §10. THE UNBEARABLE QUESTIONS

### 10.1 Can All Youth Be Redeemed?

**Honest answer:** We don't know.

Most can. Some can't. We try anyway.

**Our commitment:**
- Never give up on a 12-year-old
- Try intensively with 13-17
- Acknowledge some may need lifelong support/supervision
- Protect victims regardless

### 10.2 What If Victim and Young Person Are Both Children?

**Scenario:** 14-year-old harms 10-year-old.

**Response:**
- Both are children
- Both need protection
- Older child still accountable (age-appropriate)
- Intervention for both
- Separation maintained
- Family support for both

**Complexity:** Yes. Life is complex.

### 10.3 Is This Too Soft? Too Hard?

**Critics will say:**
- "Too soft" — young person should be in jail
- "Too hard" — young person is just a kid

**Our position:**
- Softer than prison, harder than nothing
- Balances victim safety with developmental reality
- Acknowledges some harms require long separation
- Never gives up on possibility of growth
- Never sacrifices victim to that possibility

## §11. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

### Links to:
- **HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL:** Adult version when young person turns 18
- **JUSTICE_PROTOCOL:** Restorative processes
- **SEVERE_MENTAL_ILLNESS_PROTOCOL:** When harm stems from mental health crisis
- **CRISIS_PROTOCOL:** If harm creates immediate danger
- **AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL:** Protecting system integrity

---

## §12. METRICS & ACCOUNTABILITY

### Success Indicators:
- <5 incidents per 10,000 youth annually
- 70%+ successfully reintegrate by age 21
- 0 repeat victims (same young person harms again)
- Victim satisfaction with safety measures: 90%+

### Warning Signs:
- Rising youth harm rates → systemic issues in development/support
- Low reintegration success → intervention not working
- Victims reporting unsafe → protection failing

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE

**Children are not disposable.**  
**Victims are not negotiable.**  
**Both truths must be held, even when they break our hearts.**

We protect victims absolutely.  
We work with young people intensively.  
We acknowledge some situations have no good answer.  
We try anyway.

Because what else can we do?

---

**STATUS:** ACTIVE SAFEGUARD  
**REVIEW:** Annually + after each major case  
**OATH:** We hold the impossible tension between protection and redemption.
