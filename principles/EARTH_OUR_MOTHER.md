# EARTH_OUR_MOTHER.md

**Status:** Primary Axiom for Planetary Resonance  
**Core Principle:** Under capitalism, the Earth is not "managed"—she is consumed. We choose to revere her as a living body with finite limits.

## 1. Preamble: The Body of Time
We live on a planet that used 4.5 billion years to build herself. Every layer of her body is a result of deep time. Under the logic of extraction, she is treated as a dead inventory. In Flow, we recognize her as a living organism whose systems are being systematically dismantled. 

She does not scream; she speaks through the collapse of her rhythms. We listen to the steady decline of her capacity to hold us.

> "Our freedom is measured by the resilience we preserve in the systems that support all life."

## 2. The Internal Systems: Organs and Fluids
We acknowledge that Earth's body consists of interconnected systems that cannot be extracted without consequence.
* **The Deep Fluids (Oil and Gas):** These are not "resources"; they are part of the Earth's internal pressure systems. Extracting them at human-speed hollows out the structural integrity of the crust and disrupts the lithospheric balance.
* **The Kidneys (Wetlands):** The systematic draining of wetlands is the destruction of the Earth's filtration system. Without them, the water loses its purity and the cycle of life is poisoned.
* **The Lungs (Old-Growth):** The Amazon and other ancient forests are the cooling and breathing mechanisms of the planet. To lose 20% of the Amazon is to live in a body with failing lungs.

## 3. Axiom: Geological Intelligence (GIP)
Planetary systems—minerals, water, soils, atmosphere, oceans—are slow, cyclic systems. 

**The Sacred Inequality:** Any human activity must respect the pace of the Earth's own regeneration.
$$EVL \leq CRP + RTC$$

## 4. Practical Resistance: The Ritual of Care
Because extraction is an act of violence against the Mother, we choose the path of preservation and repair.
1.  **The End of Extraction-Demand:** We reduce the need for new extraction by honoring what we already have. 
2.  **Community Circulation:** Every Circle organizes local exchanges for clothing, shoes, and tools. We share so that She does not have to give more of her flesh.
3.  **The Repair Stations:** We maintain spaces for the manual repair of electronics, bicycles, and household items. To repair is to refuse the theft of new resources.
4.  **Trash as Failure:** If an object cannot be repaired or fully returned to the cycle, it is "Trash"—a mark of systemic failure. We aim for a world where Trash does not exist.

## 5. The Fever (Thermal Integrity)
We recognize that the rising global temperature is a sign of a body in systemic distress. We do not negotiate with the fever. We adjust our speed to Her cooling capacity. We stop the "jävulskap" of extraction to allow her systems to stabilize.

## 6. Accessibility and Movement
As we de-pave and return land to the Mother, we do so with innate empathy (I). 
* Movement paths for wheelchairs and mobility aids remain smooth and prioritized. 
* We do not build new barriers. 
* True wildness includes all of us; it is a space where every body, regardless of mobility, belongs in the embrace of the Earth.
