**Status:** Primary Axiom for Planetary Resonance  
**Core Principle:** Under capitalism/Mammon, the Earth is not "managed"—it is destroyed. We choose to revere Her as our own body.

## 1. Preamble: Borrowed Time
We live on a planet that took 4.5 billion years to build itself. Mountains rose through collisions lasting millions of years. Aquifers filled drop by drop over millennia. Soil accumulated grain by grain over centuries.

Under Mammon, the Earth is destroyed. It is treated as a dead resource to be plundered for profit. In Flow, we recognize that Earth is the living body in which our sovereignty breathes. To damage Her for gain is vandalism against time itself.

> "Our freedom is measured by the resilience we preserve in the systems that support all life."

## 2. Axiom: Geological Intelligence (GIP)
Planetary systems—minerals, water, soils, atmosphere, oceans—are not inert. They are slow, cyclic, and time-dependent systems with fixed regeneration limits.

**The Sacred Inequality:** For any human activity to be valid in Flow, it must satisfy the formula:  

$$EVL \leq CRP + RTC$$

* **EVL (Extraction Velocity Limit):** The ceiling on how fast we take.
* **CRP (Circular Recovery Potential):** How much we can recover without disruption.
* **RTC (Regeneration Time Constant):** Nature’s own pace of healing or recreation.

## 3. Principles for Life-Centric Stewardship

### 3.1 Temporal Harmony
A system must never operate faster than the slowest system it depends on. We refuse to let the seconds of capitalist urgency dictate the millennia of geology, the centuries of soil formation, or the rhythms of oceanic cycles.

### 3.2 Geological Memory & The Sacred Blue
Certain formations are irreplaceable. If a structure took more than 10,000 years to form (e.g., deep aquifers, glaciers, or old-growth systems), it must not be touched. 

* **The Oceans:** We recognize the sea not as a void, but as the planet's circulatory system. No extraction may disrupt the thermal or chemical balance of the waters.

### 3.3 Thermal Integrity (Temperature)
We acknowledge that Earth’s temperature is the "fever-gauge" of Her health. Any activity that contributes to a net increase in planetary heat or disrupts the atmospheric cooling cycles is a violation of the Baseline.

## 4. Practical Implementation (Lex Finis)

### 4.1 The Death of "Waste"
We recognize no such thing as waste. Anything that does not circulate is a crime against Flow.
1.  **Direct Reuse:** Preservation of form and function.
2.  **Material Recovery:** Breakdown into raw materials.
3.  **Trash:** **SYSTEM FAILURE.** If a process generates "trash" that cannot be absorbed and transformed by our Mother, that process must be halted and redesigned immediately.

### 4.2 The 30% Mandate (Accessible Wildness)
Every Circle commits to leaving at least 30% of its area of influence to the self-organization of our Mother.

* **In Rural Zones:** Untouched reserves where forests age and fall naturally.
* **In the City:** De-paving occurs only on surfaces not required for movement—parking lots, abandoned lots, and dead zones. 
* **The Accessibility Rule:** Movement paths for wheelchairs and mobility aids are prioritized, maintained, and kept smooth. Wildness grows vertically (walls), on rooftops, and in protected zones. **Sovereign mobility is part of the Flow.** Creating barriers for a fellow human is not an act of serving nature.

## 5. Metrics for Mother Earth
Instead of profit, we measure resonance with the planet:
* **Biodiversity Index:** Is the variety of life in our vicinity increasing?
* **Regeneration Index:** Are we restoring more than we destroy?
* **Thermal Balance:** Is our energy use heat-neutral?
* **Water Purity:** Is the water cleaner after passing through our Circle than before?

---

## 6. Reflection
The Earth is the **Primary Baseline**. There is no sovereignty on a dead or boiling planet. By healing the Earth, we heal ourselves. We grow the forest so the forest can hold our Calm (**L**), we protect the Oceans to stabilize our climate, and we build smooth, accessible paths so that everyone—regardless of mobility—can roll or walk into the heart of the wild.
