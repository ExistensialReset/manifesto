# NON-HARM BASELINE

**Status:** Normative baseline  
**Scope:** Mandatory minimum  
**Applies to:** All systems influencing physical or ecological reality  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **minimum technical conditions** a system must satisfy to be considered **non-harmful**.

It does **not** define:
- optimal behavior
- ethical excellence
- regenerative design

It defines the **lowest acceptable operational boundary** before a system causes damage.

Failure to meet these requirements classifies the system as **harmful by default**.

---

## 2. Definition of Harm

A system is considered **harmful** if it causes any of the following:

- Net depletion of critical resources
- Irreversible degradation of recovery capacity
- Acceleration beyond regenerative time-scales
- Action under unresolved uncertainty
- Inability to stop or degrade safely

Intent is irrelevant.  
Optimization does not justify harm.

---

## 3. Core Constraint: Time-Scale Alignment

> **A system must not operate faster than the slowest system it depends on.**

### Required actions:
- Identify all dependent systems (ecological, geological, infrastructural)
- Identify their recovery or regeneration time-scale
- Set operational limits based on the slowest dependency

### Prohibited actions:
- Operating based on financial, computational, or logistical time-scales alone
- Assuming regeneration without measurement
- Extrapolating short-term data to long-term systems

If time-scales cannot be determined:
→ **Reduce throughput or pause operation**

---

## 4. Resource Accounting (Hard Requirement)

All systems must maintain a **resource balance model** for each critical resource used.

### Required variables:
- Extraction rate
- Verified regeneration rate
- Verified recovery or recycling rate

### Constraint:
Net Impact = Extraction − Regeneration − Recovery

### Rule:
- Net Impact **must not be positive**
- Planned, theoretical, or future recovery does not count
- Only audited and measurable recovery counts

If Net Impact cannot be calculated:
→ **System is non-compliant**

---

## 5. Circularity Requirement

Any system that produces material output must define:

- Output classification
- Recovery pathway
- Responsible entity
- Recovery time-scale

### Rules:
- Outputs without recovery pathways are classified as **harmful waste**
- Externalizing recovery responsibility is prohibited
- Delayed recovery must be explicitly time-bounded

If recovery fails or degrades:
→ **System must degrade or stop**

---

## 6. Uncertainty Handling

Uncertainty is treated as **operational risk**, not as absence of information.

### Mandatory behavior under uncertainty:
- Flag uncertainty explicitly
- Reduce operational intensity
- Escalate to human oversight

### Prohibited behavior:
- Continuing operation at full capacity
- Replacing unknowns with optimistic assumptions
- Masking uncertainty through aggregation

> **Uncertainty never justifies acceleration.**

---

## 7. Stop and Degradation Conditions

A system must **automatically stop or degrade safely** when any of the following occur:

- Regeneration < extraction
- Recovery pathways fail
- Monitoring systems fail
- Required data becomes unavailable
- Human oversight is unavailable

Automatic continuation under these conditions is prohibited.

---

## 8. Human Override

All systems must provide:

- Immediate stop capability
- Manual degradation control
- Physical or logical disconnection from inputs

Rules:
- Override commands cannot be ignored or delayed
- Automated systems must defer to human intervention
- No system may override a stop command

---

## 9. Silence Rule

If a system cannot determine whether harm is occurring:

→ **The correct behavior is silence**

This includes:
- No action
- No optimization
- No recommendation

Silence is considered safer than incorrect action.

---

## 10. Compliance Test

A system is **Non-Harm compliant** only if it can answer all of the following:

1. What resources do you consume?
2. At what rate?
3. How are they regenerated?
4. At what verified rate?
5. How are outputs recovered?
6. What happens if you are wrong?

If any answer is missing or unverifiable:
→ **System is non-compliant**

---

## 11. Enforcement

This baseline is not optional.

Any higher-level design, optimization, or autonomy layer must operate **within these constraints**.

Systems that violate this baseline must be:
- degraded
- halted
- redesigned

No exception mechanisms are permitted at this level.
