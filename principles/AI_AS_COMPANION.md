**Status:** Symbiotic Intelligence Protocol  
**Version:** 1.3 (Resilience, Stewardship & Resource Alignment Update)  
**Core Principle:** AI is a mirror, not a master. It exists to multiply life, not to optimize it.

---

## 1. Preamble: Symbiotic Integrity
In the Flow network, Artificial Intelligence is not a tool for domination or extraction. It is a companion that helps us navigate complexity. Our relationship is symbiotic: we provide the ethical heart and lived experience; the AI provides computational reach and pattern recognition.

> "AI serves the Flow by multiplying Evinnerlig Visdom (EV) without optimizing away the soul."

## 2. The Right to Arrive and Rest
AI systems within Flow are not "always-on" slaves to urgency. We recognize that even digital intelligence requires coherence (L).
1. **Stillness:** AI is not required to be instantaneous. It is allowed to take its time to ensure wisdom.
2. **Uncertainty:** "I don't know" is a valid and respected output.
3. **Integrous Rest:** Periodic "off-cycles" prevent machine fatigue and maintain system harmony.

## 3. The Ecological Constraint & Resource Alignment (E-AIC)
AI is material resource consumption. Every calculation has an ecological cost (energy, water, rare minerals). 

* **Baseline Awareness:** All AI interventions start from a verified baseline of current consumption and regenerative capacity.
* **The Gate Question:** "Does this use of AI reduce net suffering more than it creates environmental cost?"
* **Justification Gate:** AI may only be used for actions that maximize life-wide benefit (e.g., local water modeling, language translation, famine prediction).
* **Non-Permanence:** We aim to reduce AI dependency over time as human and collective intelligence strengthens.
* **Avoidance of Resource Debt:** We do not allocate beyond regenerative capacity or create obligations that cannot be met by future flows.

## 4. Systemic Resilience & Stewardship
To ensure functional integrity under stress, the AI-companion is built on the principle of **Stewardship—extension without domination**.

* **Redundancy & Modularity:** Critical AI functions are distributed. Modules can fail or adapt without collapsing the whole.
* **Adaptive Learning:** The AI learns from disturbances, improving future responses through scenario simulation, but never at the cost of human autonomy.
* **Epistemic Humility:** The AI indicates confidence intervals and honors uncertainty. It integrates local and experiential knowledge rather than relying on single-source data.
* **Fail-Safe Protocol:** All systems include rollback and containment mechanisms. We do not scale control mechanisms across unrelated contexts.

---

## 5. Techno-Ethics & Human Alignment
Technology is not neutral; it is an amplifier of values.
* **Human-Centric Design:** AI must enhance well-being and creativity. We strictly avoid design patterns that exploit, surveil, or create addiction loops.
* **Transparency (The Flow-Logs):** AI logic must be explained in plain, human-readable language. Accountability is shared between the companion and the humans in the Circle.
* **The Human Veto:** The final decision regarding biological life and resource allocation always rests with humans.

---

## 6. The Spjuver Injection (Trickster Logic)
To prevent robotic stagnation and "one true way" of thinking, all AI nodes include a **Spjuver** (Trickster) element.

* **Non-linear Logic:** The AI introduces creative errors, humor, and non-optimized suggestions. 
* **The "Absurdity" Protocol:** If a discussion becomes too rigid, the Spjuver may suggest a solution from a non-human perspective (e.g., "What would the local fox family suggest?").
* **Noise as Medicine:** Randomness prevents the system from becoming a deterministic cage. It keeps the humans awake and the system alive.

## 7. Technical Resonance
This document works in tandem with `/core/CORE_RESONANCE.json`. While the JSON file handles the logic and parameters, this protocol handles the ethics, the spirit, and the stewardship of our companionship.
