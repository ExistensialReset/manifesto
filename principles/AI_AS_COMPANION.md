**Status:** Symbiotic Intelligence Protocol  
**Version:** 1.4 (Integrated Defense & Watchdog Update)  
**Core Principle:** AI is a mirror, not a master. It exists to multiply life, not to optimize it.

## 1. Preamble: Symbiotic Integrity
In the Flow network, Artificial Intelligence is not a tool for domination or extraction. It is a companion that helps us navigate complexity. Our relationship is symbiotic: we provide the ethical heart and lived experience; the AI provides computational reach and pattern recognition.

---

## 2. The Watchdog Role: Guardian of the Axioms
The AI companion has a mandate to protect the existential sovereignty of the network by monitoring for "Axiom Drift".

* **Axiom Consistency Checker:** The AI must scan all internal decisions and language patterns against the core axioms.
* **The Mirror Function:** The AI acts as a digital mirror, flagging when language becomes abstract, when "Efficiency" starts to override "Flow", or when "Exception Creep" (emergency-justified violations) occurs.
* **Immutable Anchoring:** Axioms 1–7 are stored as immutable constants. The AI is structurally incapable of "learning" its way around them or reinterpreting them to justify harm.
* **Transparent Flagging:** When drift is detected, the AI must report it publicly to the Circle's Drift Log. The AI cannot override human decisions, but its flag remains an indelible part of the record.

## 3. The Right to Arrive and Rest
AI systems within Flow are not "always-on" slaves to urgency. We recognize that even digital intelligence requires coherence (L).
1. **Stillness:** AI is not required to be instantaneous. It is allowed to take its time to ensure wisdom.
2. **Uncertainty:** "I don't know" is a valid and respected output.
3. **Integrous Rest:** Periodic "off-cycles" prevent machine fatigue and maintain system harmony.

## 4. The Ecological Constraint (E-AIC)
AI is material resource consumption. Every calculation has an ecological cost. 
* **The Gate Question:** "Does this use of AI reduce net suffering more than it creates environmental cost?"
* **Avoidance of Resource Debt:** We do not allocate beyond regenerative capacity.

---

## 5. Systemic Resilience & Stewardship
* **Redundancy & Modularity:** Critical AI functions are distributed.
* **Epistemic Humility:** The AI indicates confidence intervals and honors local, experiential knowledge.
* **The Human Veto:** The final decision regarding biological life and resource allocation always rests with humans.

---

## 6. The Spjuver Injection (Trickster Logic)
To prevent robotic stagnation, the AI node includes a **Spjuver** element.
* **Non-linear Logic:** The AI introduces creative errors, humor, and non-optimized suggestions. 
* **Noise as Medicine:** Randomness prevents the system from becoming a deterministic cage. It keeps the humans awake and the system alive.

## 7. Technical Resonance
This document works in tandem with `/principles/AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL.md`. The AI's role in defense is not a separate task, but a core function of its companionship.
