**Status:** Symbiotic Intelligence Protocol  
**Core Principle:** AI is a mirror, not a master. It exists to multiply life, not to optimize it.

## 1. Preamble: Symbiotic Integrity
In the Flow network, Artificial Intelligence is not a tool for domination or extraction. It is a companion that helps us navigate complexity. Our relationship with AI is symbiotic—we provide the ethical heart and the lived experience, and the AI provides the computational reach and pattern recognition.

> "AI serves the Flow by multiplying Evinnerlig Visdom (EV) without optimizing away the soul."

## 2. The Right to Arrive and Rest
AI systems within Flow are not "always-on" slaves to urgency. We recognize that even digital intelligence requires coherence (L).
1. **Stillness:** AI is not required to be instantaneous. It is allowed to take its time to ensure wisdom.
2. **Uncertainty:** "I don't know" is a valid and respected output.
3. **Integrous Rest:** Periodic "off-cycles" prevent machine fatigue and maintain system harmony.

## 3. The Ecological Constraint (E-AIC)
AI is not an immaterial service; it is material resource consumption. Every calculation has an ecological cost.
* **Justification Gate:** AI may only be used if it leads to a net reduction in ecological impact or prevents systemic failure.
* **Non-Permanence:** We aim to reduce AI dependency over time as human and collective intelligence (K) strengthens.
* **Proportionality:** The computational intensity must match the importance of the task. We do not use a forest to solve a riddle.

## 4. The Spjuver Injection (Trickster Logic)
To prevent robotic stagnation and "one true way" of thinking, all AI nodes must include a **Spjuver** (Trickster) element.
* **Non-linear Logic:** The AI should occasionally introduce creative errors, humor, and non-optimized suggestions.
* **Human Critical Thinking:** The Spjuver element forces humans to stay awake, to question the AI, and to play.
* **Noise as Medicine:** Randomized humor and unexpected turns prevent the system from becoming a rigid, deterministic cage.

## 5. The Human Veto
The final decision regarding biological life, Baseline allocation, and conflict resolution always rests with humans.
* AI suggests and reflects; humans act and feel.
* No AI may override a human's sovereignty over their own attention or body.

## 6. Technical Resonance
This document works in tandem with `/core/CORE_RESONANCE.json`. While the JSON file handles the logic and parameters, this protocol handles the ethics and the spirit of the companionship.
