# SLOW_EROSION_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE WELLBEING SAFEGUARD  
**Purpose:** Address chronic decline in Flow without identifiable crisis  
**Principle:** Not all collapse is dramatic; slow erosion kills Nodes quietly

---

## §1. DETECTION MECHANISMS
- L×S×I declining month over month
- Participation drop, creativity decline, joy absence
- Canary Metrics, Mirror Protocol observation, AI trend monitoring
- Triggers: L×S×I < 0.5 for 12+ months OR multiple secondary indicators

## §2. IMMEDIATE BASELINE PROTECTION MEASURES
- Emergency support for food, shelter, healthcare if Baseline threatened
- Sabbatical or rest interventions activated immediately
- Protocol continues alongside Baseline stabilization

## §3. SCALABLE INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL WITH AI ASSISTANCE
- Minor Node fatigue: AI-assisted check-in, 1 human observer
- Medium: Hybrid AI + 2-3 humans, remote + in-person
- Major erosion: Full team (5-7), external facilitation, detailed assessment

## §4. REQUIRED EXPERTISE AND ROLE VERIFICATION
- Expertise in facilitation, mental health, Node governance
- Access to regional support networks
- Documentation templates for restoration/dissolution
- Simplified measures if expertise unavailable, document gaps

## §5. RESTORATION PATHWAYS
- Sabbatical (most common)
- External Facilitation (intensive)
- Partial Dissolution + Reformation
- Complete Reset (location/structure)

## §6. PROTOCOL PRIORITY MATRIX INTEGRATION
- Baseline Emergency overrides rest-based interventions
- Harm to persons or sudden crisis takes precedence
- Wellbeing interventions proceed concurrently if non-critical

## §7. METRICS AND FEEDBACK
- L×S×I trends before/after restoration
- Recovery rate, dissolution rate
- Lessons fed to regional coordination AI and Node archives

## §8. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND
- Quiet collapse is still collapse
- Rest is strength; ending may be appropriate
- Joy and vitality are central to Node existence

**STATUS:** ACTIVE  
**REVIEW:** Annually + whenever slow erosion detected  
**OATH:** Notice quiet dying; intervene with rest or release
