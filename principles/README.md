## Welcome

This directory contains the **core principles of the Manifesto**, organized by theme but deeply interconnected.  
It is designed to guide reflection, action, and systemic design—**not to dictate outcomes**.

> _"Principles are the architecture of thought; the bridge between intention and realization."_

## Purpose

The `/principles` directory provides:

- **Ethical guidance**: AI, technology, social systems, ecology  
- **Structural understanding**: How living, conscious systems operate  
- **Phenomenological insight**: Grace, emergence, and Σ-awareness  
- **Practical orientation**: Applications for institutions, communities, and individual practice

All files are **cross-referenced**. Reading them together deepens understanding of DIVINE coherence and the unmeasurable measure (Σ).
