**Status:** Proposed Axiomatic Extension  
**Principle:** Harm is a signal of dysregulation; Repair is the restoration of Flow.

## Preamble: The Mending of Sovereignty

In Mammon-logic, harm—be it theft, betrayal, or violence—is treated as a moral failure to be punished. Pain is exchanged for pain, isolation for isolation, as if suffering itself could restore order.

In Flow, we recognize harm as a **signal**, not a verdict.

Harm indicates a rupture in a node’s internal L (Calm) or in the circle’s shared I (Innate Empathy). When a human causes harm, it is often because their own baseline of safety, dignity, or belonging has already collapsed.

Justice, therefore, is not retribution.  
Justice is **repair**.

We apply the **Kintsugi Principle**: what has broken is repaired with care and visibility, not hidden or discarded. The scar is not erased. It becomes a site of learning and strengthened connection.

---

## §1. The Restorative Stack  
*Justice moves at the speed of the nervous system.*

We do not rush toward judgment. We descend through layers of restoration until Flow is either re-established or safely separated.

---

### 1. Regulation Before Dialogue

No truth can be accessed in a state of fight, flight, or freeze.

Both the harmed and the person who caused harm are first offered access to **Refugium Anima** — sanctuary, silence, warmth, and time — to regulate their nervous systems.

Justice begins with breath.  
An agitated body cannot access empathy, accountability, or repair.

This phase has **no deadline**.

---

### 2. The Somatic Testimony

Truth is not extracted; it is listened for.

Instead of adversarial interrogation, testimony begins in the body:

- “Where in your body does this event reside?”
- “How has your breathing changed since the incident?”
- “Does your skin feel safe in this space?”

The nervous system cannot convincingly lie.  
Somatic resonance is treated as primary data.

Narratives are secondary to **felt safety**.

---

### 3. Voluntary Gift as Healing

Repair is not a punishment imposed from above.  
It is an **invitation to re-enter Flow**.

Possible pathways include:

- **Logistical Reset**  
  Resources taken or damaged are returned or replaced — not as a fine, but as a ritual restoration of the physical baseline.

- **Resonance Contribution**  
  The person who caused harm is invited to offer their gifts — skill, time, care, creativity — in service of restoring trust.

This contribution is **voluntary, specific, and finite**.  
It is not forced labor.  
It is a reclaiming of sovereignty through usefulness without shame.

---

## §2. Witnessing & Collective Holding

Justice is never private revenge.

Each restorative process is held by a small circle of **Human Mirrors** whose role is to:

- Witness without escalation
- Maintain boundary clarity
- Protect the nervous systems of all involved
- Interrupt domination, coercion, or narrative manipulation

They do not judge.  
They **hold the container**.

---

## §3. Protective Coexistence (The Last Resort)

If repair repeatedly fails, or if physical safety is at risk, Flow chooses **Honorable Distance**.

This is not exile.  
It is boundary.

### Core conditions:

- **Baseline Inviolability**  
  The person who caused harm retains unconditional access to food, housing, and healthcare.  
  No human is made homeless or hungry as punishment.

- **Separation of Flows**  
  Physical, spatial, or logistical separation may be enacted to protect the harmed party’s L (Calm).

- **No Incarceration**  
  Bodies are not placed in cages.  
  Separation exists only to reduce harm and allow regulation.

Distance is maintained **until readiness for repair emerges voluntarily** — or indefinitely, if necessary.

---

## §4. Chronic Harm & Pattern Recognition

Flow is compassionate, not naive.

If a pattern of repeated harm emerges:

- The system documents **patterns, not identities**
- Additional containment layers may be introduced
- Support intensifies rather than withdraws

Persistent harm is treated as **deep dysregulation**, not evil.

The system protects others **without dehumanizing the source**.

---

## §5. Irreversibility Clause

Some harms cannot be fully undone.

Flow does not demand impossible reconciliation.

In such cases:

- The goal becomes **containment, remembrance, and prevention**
- The harmed party is never pressured to forgive
- Repair may occur asymmetrically

Justice does not require emotional closure.  
It requires **safety and truth**.

---

## Final Principle: Justice Is the Return of Flow

Justice in Flow is not about balancing a ledger of pain.  
It is the courageous act of refusing to throw people away.

We do not ask:  
> “Who deserves punishment?”

We ask:  
> “What does safety require now — and what would allow Flow to return later, if ever?”

Justice is patience with boundaries.  
Justice is repair without humiliation.  
Justice is remembering that **no one is disposable**.
