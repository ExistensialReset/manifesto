/principles

Purpose

The /principles directory contains the normative, ethical, epistemological, and structural foundations of the Existensial Reset / DIVINE framework.

These documents:

Define values, constraints, and invariants

Set ethical and ecological boundaries

Articulate what must remain true across all implementations


They are upstream of all technical, architectural, and measurement documents.

Nothing in /annex, /systems, or /implementations may contradict the principles defined here.

How to Read This Directory

You do not need to read everything linearly.

Recommended approach:

1. Start with MANIFESTO.md for orientation


2. Read DIVINE.md for the core synthesis


3. Use the thematic clusters below as needed



This directory is meant to be returned to, not consumed once.

Index of Principles

Core Orientation

MANIFESTO.md
The foundational declaration of intent, worldview, and refusal.

DIVINE.md
The core synthesis: life, resonance, consciousness fields, and the Frejd Equation.

Relationship to Other Directories

/principles → Why and What must remain true

/annex → Supporting, technical, or contextual documents

If a conflict appears:

> Principles override implementation. Always.

New principles may be added when reality demands it


Changes must be:

Explicit

Documented

Ethically justified

Closing Note

These texts are not laws.

They are guardrails for dignity, life, and meaning.

Return here whenever the system feels clever but wrong.

That is what /principles is for.
