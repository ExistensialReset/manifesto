/principles

Purpose

The /principles directory contains the normative, ethical, epistemological, and structural foundations of the Existensial Reset / DIVINE framework.

These documents:

Define values, constraints, and invariants

Set ethical and ecological boundaries

Articulate what must remain true across all implementations


They are upstream of all technical, architectural, and measurement documents.

Nothing in /annex, /systems, or /implementations may contradict the principles defined here.

How to Read This Directory

You do not need to read everything linearly.

Recommended approach:

1. Start with MANIFESTO.md for orientation


2. Read DIVINE.md for the core synthesis


3. Use the thematic clusters below as needed



This directory is meant to be returned to, not consumed once.

Relationship to Other Directories

/principles → Why and What must remain true

/annex → Supporting, technical, or contextual documents

/systems → Concrete designs and implementations


If a conflict appears:

> Principles override implementation. Always.

Status of This Directory

This directory is alive.

Documents may evolve

Axioms may be refined (never casually removed)

New principles may be added when reality demands it


Changes must be:

Explicit

Documented

Ethically justified

Closing Note

These texts are not laws.

They are guardrails for dignity, life, and meaning.

Return here whenever the system feels clever but wrong.

That is what /principles is for.
