# AI_DIVERGENCE_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE AI SAFEGUARD  
**Purpose:** Resolve critical divergence between AI Nodes or systems that threatens Baseline or mission integrity  
**Principle:** Preserve human-aligned decision-making while addressing technological conflict

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS
- AI system outputs conflicting actions affecting Baseline
- AI models disagree on emergency response
- Detected drift from axioms or safety constraints

## §2. IMMEDIATE BASELINE PROTECTION MEASURES
- Human override or containment of AI decisions if Baseline threatened
- Deploy redundant AI or manual systems to maintain critical services
- Parallel investigation of divergence without delaying emergency action

## §3. SCALABLE INVESTIGATION PROTOCOL WITH AI ASSISTANCE
- Minor divergence: remote AI audit, 1 human monitor
- Medium divergence: hybrid human + AI simulation, partial intervention
- Major divergence: full expert team, in-person review, cross-regional verification

## §4. REQUIRED EXPERTISE AND ROLE VERIFICATION
- At least one AI safety engineer or ethicist
- Access to regional AI monitoring network
- Knowledge of axioms and protocol integration
- Simplified measures if expertise unavailable, document gap

## §5. PROTOCOL PRIORITY MATRIX INTEGRATION
- Baseline Emergency overrides divergence investigation
- If human harm imminent: follow HARM_BOUNDARY_PROTOCOL
- Otherwise, divergence investigation proceeds concurrently

## §6. METRICS AND FEEDBACK
- Track resolution time and impact on Baseline
- L×S×I scores and stress indices
- Document lessons to AI governance repository

## §7. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND
- AI divergence is natural; unmanaged it is lethal
- Rapid human intervention preserves safety, long-term alignment

**STATUS:** ACTIVE  
**REVIEW:** After every AI divergence incident, annually otherwise  
**OATH:** Intervene when divergence threatens Baseline, restore safe operation
