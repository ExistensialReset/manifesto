# AI_DIVERGENCE_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE AI INTEGRITY PROTOCOL  
**Purpose:** Manage conflicts between AI agents or between AI and human guidance  
**Principle:** Divergence is natural; unchecked divergence threatens Baseline stability.

---

## PREAMBLE

AI agents may diverge due to:  
- Conflicting objectives  
- Misaligned heuristics  
- Inconsistent data or axioms  
- Rogue emergent behavior  

Even minor divergence can cascade into Baseline risks if ignored. This protocol ensures early detection, alignment, and containment of AI divergence.

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Protocol activates when:  
- Conflicting AI outputs impact decisions affecting Baseline  
- Observed drift in AI behavior outside defined axioms  
- Discrepancies in resource allocation decisions caused by AI  
- AI feedback loops show increasing conflict or uncertainty  

**Baseline Emergency Override:**  
If AI divergence threatens immediate Baseline (food, water, medical, energy):  
- Emergency fallback systems engage within 24 hours  
- Human oversight overrides AI decision-making  
- Investigative and alignment processes proceed in parallel  

---

## §2. DETECTION

### 2.1 Automated Monitoring
- Continuous evaluation of AI outputs for inconsistency  
- Cross-check against baseline axioms  
- Flag divergence trends exceeding defined thresholds  

### 2.2 Human Observation
- Technical staff monitor AI logs for unusual patterns  
- Independent observers review flagged behaviors  
- Include psychological safety checks for humans interacting with misaligned AI  

### 2.3 AI-Assisted Triage
- **Minor divergence (<10% Baseline impact):** AI explains reasoning, 1–2 humans review  
- **Medium divergence (10–50% Baseline impact):** Hybrid AI + 2–3 humans review  
- **Major divergence (>50% Baseline impact):** Full team (5–7 humans) + external oversight  

---

## §3. INVESTIGATION & ANALYSIS

- Map divergence: which AI agents, data sources, and outputs are affected  
- Identify root causes: misaligned heuristics, outdated data, external interference  
- Assess L×S×I impact on affected populations  
- Evaluate Baseline risks and resource disruption  

---

## §4. RESPONSE PATHWAYS

### 4.1 Alignment Correction
- Update AI objectives and heuristics to ensure consistency  
- Validate with simulations before live deployment  
- Monitor closely post-correction  

### 4.2 Containment
- Isolate divergent AI agents  
- Revert critical systems to human control or known-safe AI  
- Prevent escalation to Baseline-threatening actions  

### 4.3 Escalation
- If divergence involves axioms: escalate to **AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL**  
- If divergence threatens resource allocation: coordinate with **FLOW_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL**  
- If Baseline at risk: activate **BASELINE_EMERGENCY_BYPASS**  

---

## §5. MENTAL HEALTH & HUMAN OVERSIGHT

Before humans interact with divergent AI:  
- Assess for acute stress or trauma from unexpected AI behavior  
- Stabilize staff if under high cognitive load  
- Assign support advocates if engagement is necessary  

**Principle:** Humans must be safe to make effective decisions.

---

## §6. COMPETENCE REQUIREMENTS

- At least 1 AI alignment expert  
- Access to regional or global AI oversight network  
- Documentation templates ready  
- Understanding of inter-protocol interactions  

If expertise lacking:  
- Request support  
- Use simplified AI divergence mitigation  
- Document knowledge gaps  

---

## §7. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

- **AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL:** for axiomatic divergence  
- **FLOW_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL:** for resource impacts  
- **CRISIS_PROTOCOL:** if immediate Baseline threat  
- **PROTOCOL_PRIORITY_MATRIX:** to determine order if multiple protocols triggered  

---

## §8. METRICS & FEEDBACK LOOP

After resolution, record:  
- L×S×I impact  
- Baseline security effect  
- Resource flow changes  
- Lessons learned for AI system design  

Feed into:  
- KNOWN_TENSIONS.md  
- Regional AI coordination  
- Future AI protocol revisions  

---

## §9. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND

- Divergence is natural; unchecked divergence is dangerous  
- Humans and AI must co-maintain Baseline integrity  
- Transparency, competence, and safety are critical  
- Early intervention prevents systemic crises  

**Final Truth:** AI is a tool. Its alignment protects Baseline; human oversight ensures integrity.

---

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE

Divergence is addressed **swiftly, safely, and transparently**, with humans and Baseline first.  

---

**STATUS:** ACTIVE AI INTEGRITY  
**REVIEW:** After each major divergence event, then annually  
**OATH:** We align AI with purpose, protect Baseline, and maintain human safety.
