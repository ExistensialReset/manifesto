# FLOW_VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE RESOURCE INTEGRITY  
**Purpose:** Ensure accurate monitoring and allocation of resources across Nodes and Regions  
**Principle:** Flow accuracy protects Baseline; discrepancies must be corrected immediately.

---

## PREAMBLE

Flow discrepancies can appear as:  
- Missing food, water, or energy units  
- Misrouted resources between Nodes  
- Unexpected losses in supply chains  
- Conflicting reports from Nodes  

Unchecked, discrepancies can lead to Baseline failure.

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Protocol activates when:  
- L×S×I data indicates potential scarcity  
- Resource accounting shows discrepancies >5%  
- Reports of failed deliveries, unexplained shortages, or hoarding  

**Baseline Emergency Override:**  
If discrepancies threaten immediate Baseline (food, water, medical, shelter):  
- Emergency redistribution activates within 24 hours  
- Investigations proceed in parallel  
- Temporary resource allocation bypasses standard channels

## §2. DETECTION & TRIAGE

### 2.1 Automated Monitoring
- AI cross-checks inventory and consumption reports  
- Flags anomalies exceeding tolerance thresholds  
- Logs discrepancies for human review  

### 2.2 Human Observation
- Regional coordinators verify flagged discrepancies  
- Investigators check transport logs and storage facilities  
- Psychological safety checks for staff handling high-stress data  

### 2.3 AI-Assisted Triage
- Minor discrepancies (<10% Baseline impact): AI review + 1–2 humans  
- Medium discrepancies (10–50% Baseline impact): Hybrid AI + 2–3 humans  
- Major discrepancies (>50% Baseline impact): Full team (5–7 humans) + external oversight  

---

## §3. INVESTIGATION

- Identify missing or misallocated resources  
- Map all flows between Nodes, Regions, and sub-units  
- Determine cause: human error, sabotage, AI miscalculation, or external event  
- Assess L×S×I impact and Baseline risk  

---

## §4. RESPONSE PATHWAYS

### 4.1 Correction
- Reallocate resources to correct shortages  
- Adjust accounting to reflect true availability  
- Verify deliveries and consumption  

### 4.2 Containment
- Isolate Nodes or channels causing repeated discrepancies  
- Limit further resource transfers until verified  
- Ensure Baseline remains secure  

### 4.3 Escalation
- If sabotage suspected: escalate to **INFRASTRUCTURE_SABOTAGE_PROTOCOL**  
- If divergence in AI calculations: escalate to **AI_DIVERGENCE_PROTOCOL**  
- If immediate Baseline threat: activate **BASELINE_EMERGENCY_BYPASS**  

---

## §5. COMPETENCE REQUIREMENTS

- At least 1 resource logistics expert  
- Access to regional inventory and AI monitoring systems  
- Training in discrepancy investigation and human oversight  

If lacking competence:  
- Request regional support  
- Use simplified verification  
- Document knowledge gap  

---

## §6. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

- **INFRASTRUCTURE_SABOTAGE_PROTOCOL:** for intentional interference  
- **AI_DIVERGENCE_PROTOCOL:** for AI misalignment affecting flow  
- **CRISIS_PROTOCOL:** for immediate life-threatening resource shortages  
- **PROTOCOL_PRIORITY_MATRIX:** to determine order if multiple protocols triggered  

---

## §7. METRICS & FEEDBACK LOOP

After resolution, record:  
- L×S×I impact  
- Baseline security changes  
- Resource flow improvements  
- Lessons learned  

Feed data into:  
- KNOWN_TENSIONS.md  
- Regional and global Flow AI coordination  
- Future protocol refinements  

---

## §8. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND

- Flow integrity safeguards life  
- Transparency, competence, and speed prevent systemic failure  
- Investigations are evidence-based, not punitive  
- Early detection saves Baseline and trust  

**Final Truth:** Accurate Flow = Baseline safety = Node stability.

---

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE

Flow discrepancies are addressed **swiftly, accurately, and transparently**, always prioritizing Baseline first.  

---

**STATUS:** ACTIVE RESOURCE INTEGRITY  
**REVIEW:** After major discrepancies, then annually  
**OATH:** We maintain Flow integrity, protect Baseline, and act with competence.
