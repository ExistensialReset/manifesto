Mapping of Debt-Based Systems and Sources of Friction

This document provides a clinical analysis of the structures, behaviors, and logics of the old debt-based system ("Mammon-Logic"). Its purpose is not to punish, but to illuminate the sources of existential friction for those reclaiming Flow.


---

I. LOGIC OF DEBT

Debt defines human value in transactional terms.

Life, attention, and agency are subordinated to repayment obligations.

Compliance is enforced via scarcity, leverage, and conditional access.


II. LOGIC OF OBEDIENCE

Authority is validated by enforcement, not by truth.

Obedience to hierarchy replaces autonomous decision-making.

Violation triggers punishment, exclusion, or loss of resources.


III. LOGIC OF EXCLUSION

Access to essentials (food, housing, healthcare) is conditional.

Social and economic participation is restricted by prior debt or status.

Survival is tied to system compliance, creating structural anxiety.


IV. LOGIC OF FRAGMENTATION

Knowledge, resources, and networks are siloed.

Individuals are incentivized to compete rather than collaborate.

Systems reproduce inefficiency and dependence on leverage mechanisms.


V. TRANSITION LESSONS

Friction in these systems can be identified objectively: where survival depends on compliance, debt, or leverage.

Recognizing these structures allows the seeker to navigate toward Baseline and Flow.

Mammonology is a map, not a set of rules; it guides action without coercion.

CONCLUSION: Understanding Mammon-Logic is essential for reclaiming existential sovereignty. By seeing the friction points clearly, one can prioritize Flow, maintain the Baseline, and exercise agency without interference from legacy systems.
