# REGIONAL_DEADLOCK_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION  
**Purpose:** Address conflicts between large regional networks (50+ Nodes)  
**Principle:** Scale changes everything. What works for 2 Nodes fails at 2,000.

---

## PREAMBLE: WHEN CONFLICT GOES CONTINENTAL

The Mandate of Nine Moons works beautifully for:
- Two Nodes arguing over a building
- A Circle split on governance
- Local resource disputes

**But what about:**
- Region A (500 Nodes) vs. Region B (300 Nodes) over river water rights?
- Continental disagreement on resource allocation during climate crisis?
- Bioregional split over whether to accept refugees from collapsed area?

**Scale changes:**
- Too many people for single Council
- Too much at stake for dice
- Too slow for 9 months when thousands are affected

**This protocol exists for when conflict is measured in regions, not Nodes.**

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Regional Deadlock Protocol activates when:

1. **Scale:** 50+ Nodes involved on at least one side
2. **Baseline Threat:** Conflict threatens Baseline for 1,000+ people
3. **Exhaustion:** Local mediation, resource-sharing, Needs-Mapping all attempted
4. **Timeline:** Conflict unresolved for 6+ months despite intervention
5. **Consensus:** Both regions agree deadlock is real

**Example triggers:**
- Water rights during severe drought
- Land use conflict (conservation vs. agriculture)
- Migration/refugee acceptance disputes
- Resource allocation during climate event
- Infrastructure placement (dam, wind farm, etc.)

---

## §2. IMMEDIATE STABILIZATION

### 2.1 Baseline Protection Override

**Before any resolution process:**

**Ensure no one is dying while we negotiate.**

**Actions:**
- Emergency resource distribution to most affected
- Temporary sharing agreements (30-90 days)
- Baseline needs met for all parties
- Crisis mode if necessary (see CRISIS_PROTOCOL)

**Principle:** You can't mediate when people are starving.

### 2.2 Conflict Freeze

Both regions commit to:
- No escalation of actions
- No unilateral resource seizure
- No propaganda campaigns
- No recruitment of other regions to "their side"

**Freeze duration:** Until resolution process completes.

**Enforcement:** Regional networks who violate freeze lose access to bioregional support systems for 1 year.

---

## §3. ASSESSMENT PHASE (30 Days)

### 3.1 Conflict Mapping Team

**Composition:**
- 5-7 people from **uninvolved regions**
- Mix of technical experts and mediators
- AI-assisted data analysis
- No one with stake in outcome

**Role:**
- Understand what's actually being fought over
- Map all positions and needs
- Identify if this is:
  - A. True scarcity (one fixed resource, multiple needs)
  - B. Artificial scarcity (could be resolved with creativity)
  - C. Value conflict (incompatible visions of how to live)

### 3.2 Output: Conflict Report

Document includes:
- Physical facts (water availability, land characteristics, etc.)
- Positions of each side
- Underlying needs (L × S × I analysis for both regions)
- Historical context
- Future scenarios if unresolved
- Potential creative solutions

**Distributed to:** All Nodes in both regions, bioregional network, global Flow archives

**Transparency:** No secret reports. Everyone sees the same data.

## §4. RESOLUTION PATHWAYS

### 4.1 Path A: Technical Solution (30%)

**When conflict is actually solvable with better information/technology.**

**Examples:**
- Water conflict → better catchment systems mean both can have enough
- Land use → regenerative agriculture allows both conservation and food production
- Energy → solar expansion means no zero-sum competition

**Process:**
1. Technical experts propose solutions
2. Both regions test proposals via simulation
3. Pilot implementation (6 months)
4. Evaluate results
5. Scale if successful

**Timeline:** 6-12 months

**Success rate:** ~30% of regional conflicts (the easy ones)

---

### 4.2 Path B: Structured Sharing (40%)

**When resource truly limited but divisible.**

**Examples:**
- Water rights: upstream/downstream regions alternate priority seasons
- Land use: temporal rotation (grazing one year, crops next)
- Energy grid: load-sharing with clear protocols

**Process:**
1. Resource Allocation Council (15 people, balanced from both regions + neutrals)
2. Design sharing protocol based on:
   - Baseline needs (priority)
   - Historical use
   - Future sustainability
   - Equity between regions
3. Trial period (1 year)
4. Adjustment based on results
5. Long-term treaty

**Timeline:** 6-18 months

**Success rate:** ~40% of regional conflicts

**Key:** Must include monitoring and adjustment mechanisms. No "set it and forget it."

---

### 4.3 Path C: Parallel Mandates (20%)

**When deadlock is complex with multiple sub-issues.**

**Approach:**
- Break conflict into component parts
- Run multiple Mandate of Nine Moons processes simultaneously
- Each addresses one sub-conflict
- Different Councils for each

**Example:**

Water conflict actually involves:
- Industrial use allocation
- Agricultural use allocation  
- Residential use allocation
- Ecosystem preservation

**Process:**
1. Identify 3-5 sub-conflicts
2. Launch Mandate for each
3. Councils work in parallel (not sequentially — saves time)
4. Results integrated into comprehensive solution

**Timeline:** 9 months (same as single Mandate, but covers more)

**Success rate:** ~20% (for truly complex situations)

---

### 4.4 Path D: Bioregional Fork (5%)

**When values are truly incompatible.**

**Examples:**
- One region wants high-tech, another wants low-tech
- One prioritizes wilderness, another prioritizes agriculture
- One wants open borders, another wants selective immigration

**Reality:** Sometimes regions just need to operate differently.

**Process:**
1. Acknowledge value divergence is real
2. Design "soft separation":
   - Regions maintain independence on disputed topic
   - Continue cooperation on everything else
   - Resource flows continue where possible
   - No hostility, just difference
3. Regular check-ins (every 5 years) to see if convergence possible

**Timeline:** Immediate (once recognized as values conflict)

**Success rate:** ~5% (rare, but honest)

**Example:**

"Region A will manage their watershed with industrial agriculture. Region B will manage theirs with permaculture. Both commit to not polluting downstream. We revisit in 5 years to compare L×S×I outcomes."

---

### 4.5 Path E: Escalation to Global Flow Network (5%)

**When conflict affects entire continents or threatens Flow itself.**

**Triggers:**
- Climate crisis decisions
- Pandemic response
- Major migration waves
- Resource collapse threatening millions

**Process:**
1. Regional deadlock formally recognized as global concern
2. Continental Flow Councils convene
3. Global AI modeling of scenarios
4. Binding recommendations (yes, **binding** — this is the only place Flow has enforceable global decisions)
5. Implementation monitored by global network

**Timeline:** 3-6 months (faster than local processes because stakes are existential)

**Authority:** Global Flow network can override regional autonomy **only** when:
- Millions of Baselines at risk
- Regional decision would collapse neighboring regions
- Ecosystem damage would be irreversible

**Check:** Requires 80% global consensus. Not simple majority.

**Example:**

"Climate models show this dam would destroy fisheries feeding 2 million people. Global Flow network overrides Region A's plan, compensates them with alternative energy infrastructure."

---

## §5. WHEN RESOLUTION FAILS

### 5.1 Structured Coexistence (Permanent Version)

If no path succeeds after 18 months:

**Accept the deadlock.**

**Outcome:**
- Resource divided 50/50 (or proportional to population)
- Strict monitoring and enforcement
- Regular mediation check-ins
- Both regions live with tension

**Not ideal. But better than violence.**

### 5.2 The Final Option: Separation

**Very rare. Very serious.**

If conflict makes coexistence impossible:

**Regions separate entirely:**
- No resource sharing
- Minimal interaction
- Each must become self-sufficient
- Bioregional network reduces connection

**Conditions:**
- Both regions vote for separation (75% threshold)
- Baseline security demonstrated for both
- Agreed-upon boundaries
- No harm to ecosystems
- Reversible (can reconnect if both want)

**Example:**

"Region A and Region B have fundamentally incompatible approaches to technology. After 2 years of mediation, both vote to separate. They become independent bioregions within Flow, with minimal exchange."

**Consequence:** Both regions lose benefits of broader network. But gain autonomy.

**Timeline:** Separation takes 1 year to implement safely.

---

## §6. SPECIAL CASES

### 6.1 Climate Emergency Override

**Scenario:** Drought/fire/flood requires immediate regional coordination.

**Response:**
- All deadlock processes pause
- Emergency resource sharing activates
- Survival first, negotiation second
- Resume mediation after crisis stabilizes

**Principle:** You don't mediate during evacuation.

### 6.2 When One Region is Clearly Wrong

**Scenario:** Region A wants to dam river. All evidence shows it will destroy Region B's ecosystem and Baseline.

**Question:** Do we still mediate?

**Answer:**

**Short version:** Yes, but with boundaries.

**Process:**
1. Evidence presented transparently
2. If overwhelming data shows harm, bioregional network can issue **Strong Recommendation Against**
3. Region A can still proceed, but:
   - Loses access to regional support
   - Must fully compensate Region B
   - If Baseline violated, Flow Network intervenes

**Analogy:** You can smoke, but not in the shared room.

### 6.3 Historical Grievance Conflicts

**Scenario:** Region A and B have 200-year history of land disputes.

**Complication:** Current conflict is about water, but really it's about old wounds.

**Response:**
1. Acknowledge historical trauma
2. Separate current conflict from historical one
3. Offer restorative process for historical grief (parallel to current mediation)
4. Don't let past prevent addressing present need

**Reality:** Some wounds don't heal. But Baseline still needs securing.

---

## §7. PREVENTION

### 7.1 Bioregional Councils

**Standing bodies** (not just crisis response):
- Meet quarterly
- Review resource flows
- Identify emerging tensions early
- Mediate before escalation
- Plan for climate scenarios

**Composition:** Rotating representatives from all Nodes in bioregion.

### 7.2 Resource Monitoring

**Continuous tracking:**
- Water levels
- Soil health  
- Energy production/consumption
- Food security
- Population pressures

**Early warning:** If scarcity approaching, start planning now (not when crisis hits).

### 7.3 Relationship Building

**Regular inter-regional exchanges:**
- People visit other regions
- Cultural exchanges
- Shared projects
- Build trust before it's needed

**Principle:** Harder to fight people you know.

---

## §8. INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROTOCOLS

### Links to:
- **MANDATE_OF_NINE_MOONS:** Local version, inspiration for regional scale
- **SHARED_RESOURCE_CONFLICT:** Smaller-scale resource disputes
- **CRISIS_PROTOCOL:** Emergency response when deadlock threatens Baseline
- **AXIOM_DEFENSE_PROTOCOL:** If conflict involves axiom violations

---

## §9. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND

**Why this exists:**

Flow is not utopia. Scarcity is real. Conflicts will happen.

**But:**

At scale, conflict can destroy Baseline for thousands.

**So we need:**
- Faster processes than 9 months
- Broader participation than 7 people
- Binding authority (rare, but real)

**Balance:**
- Maintain regional autonomy
- Intervene only when necessary
- Trust mediation, but have enforcement
- Prefer cooperation, accept separation if needed

**Final truth:**

Not all conflicts resolve.  
Some regions will always have tension.  
That's okay — as long as **no one's Baseline collapses** because of it.

---

## §10. METRICS

### Success Indicators:
- 90%+ of regional conflicts resolve within 18 months
- <1% require global intervention
- Zero Baseline violations during mediation
- 70%+ of participants satisfied with outcome (even if not preferred)

### Warning Signs:
- Increasing number of deadlocks → resources/climate worsening
- Low resolution rate → mediation process failing
- Regions leaving Flow network → system losing legitimacy

---

## CLOSING PRINCIPLE

**Conflict at scale requires structure at scale.**  
**But structure without sovereignty becomes tyranny.**  
**We hold the tension: coordinated but not coercive.**

Scale doesn't erase autonomy.  
Urgency doesn't erase process.  
Conflict doesn't erase humanity.

---

**STATUS:** ACTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION  
**REVIEW:** After first major regional deadlock, then annually  
**OATH:** We mediate with patience, act with urgency when Baseline is at risk.
