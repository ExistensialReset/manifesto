# REGIONAL_DEADLOCK_PROTOCOL.md

**Status:** ACTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION  
**Purpose:** Address conflicts between large regional networks (50+ Nodes)  
**Principle:** Scale changes everything. What works for 2 Nodes fails at 2,000.

---

## PREAMBLE

Local conflict methods fail at regional scale. Deadlock threatens Baseline for thousands if unresolved.  

**Claude-Tillägg:** Emergency Baseline Override, AI-assisted triage, competence checks.

---

## §1. TRIGGER CONDITIONS

Activates when:  
- ≥50 Nodes involved on any side  
- Baseline threat to 1,000+ people  
- Local mediation exhausted  
- Deadlock persists 6+ months  

**Baseline Emergency Override:**  
- Immediate resource protection  
- Temporary sharing agreements  
- Activate crisis response in parallel  

---

## §2. IMMEDIATE STABILIZATION

- **Conflict Freeze:** No escalation, propaganda, recruitment  
- Enforcement: Violators lose bioregional support for 1 year  

---

## §3. ASSESSMENT PHASE (30 Days)

- **Conflict Mapping Team:** 5–7 people + AI analysis, no stake in outcome  
- Map positions, needs, and resource constraints  
- Identify scarcity vs. value conflict  

**AI-Assisted Triage:** Scale team based on Baseline impact

## §4. RESOLUTION PATHWAYS

1. **Path A: Technical Solution (~30%)**  
   - Test technological fixes  
   - Pilot 6 months, scale if successful  

2. **Path B: Structured Sharing (~40%)**  
   - Resource Allocation Council  
   - Rotate allocation, trial period 1 year  

3. **Path C: Parallel Mandates (~20%)**  
   - Break conflict into sub-issues  
   - Multiple Mandate of Nine Moons processes  

4. **Path D: Bioregional Fork (~5%)**  
   - Soft separation on incompatible values  
   - Continue cooperation on other topics  

5. **Path E: Global Flow Escalation (~5%)**  
   - Continental/global intervention  
   - Binding recommendations if millions at risk  

---

## §5. WHEN RESOLUTION FAILS

- **Structured Coexistence:** 50/50 resource division, monitored  
- **Final Option: Separation:** Only if 75% vote, Baseline secured  

---

## §6. SPECIAL CASES

- Climate emergencies override normal process  
- Clear overwhelming harm → Strong Recommendation Against  
- Historical grievances treated separately  

---

## §7. PREVENTION

- Bioregional Councils quarterly  
- Continuous resource monitoring  
- Inter-regional exchanges to build trust  

---

## §8. COMPETENCE REQUIREMENTS

- Mediation expertise, AI support, resource coordination  
- If lacking, request regional support, document knowledge gap  

---

## §9. METRICS & FEEDBACK LOOP

- Resolution within 18 months  
- <1% require global intervention  
- Zero Baseline violations  
- Participant satisfaction ≥70%  

---

## §10. PHILOSOPHICAL GROUND

- Autonomy balanced with intervention  
- Scale demands structure without tyranny  
- Not all conflicts resolve; tension is acceptable if Baseline safe  

---

**CLOSING PRINCIPLE:**  
Act **coordinated but not coercive**, urgent when Baseline threatened.  

---

**STATUS:** ACTIVE CONFLICT RESOLUTION  
**REVIEW:** After first major regional deadlock, then annually  
**OATH:** Mediate with patience, act urgently when Baseline at risk.
