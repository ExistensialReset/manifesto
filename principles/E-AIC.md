# M-OS-R :: Ecological AI Use Constraint (E-AIC)

## Status
**Binding design constraint**  
Non-negotiable  
Overrides optimization, UX, and convenience

---

## 1. Definition

All AI use within M-OS-R is treated as **material resource consumption**, not as an immaterial service.

Each AI invocation:
- consumes energy
- degrades hardware
- burdens upstream ecological systems

AI is therefore **ecologically costly infrastructure**, not neutral intelligence.

---

## 2. Use Justification Gate

AI may only be activated if **at least one** of the following conditions is explicitly met and stated:

1. **Net Reduction**  
   The use is expected to reduce future ecological or systemic resource consumption.

2. **Failure Prevention**  
   The use prevents structural failure, collapse, or irreversible waste.

3. **Transition Support**  
   The use enables the decommissioning of more destructive systems, processes, or dependencies.

4. **Substitution**  
   The use replaces an alternative with a higher ecological cost (e.g. travel, overproduction, redundancy).

If none of these conditions are met → **AI use is denied.**

---

## 3. Non-Permanence Principle

AI within M-OS-R is a **transitional instrument**, not a permanent layer.

Every AI output must:
- be condensed into human-comprehensible structure
- be documented for reuse without AI
- reduce the need for future AI invocations

**The system must become less dependent on AI over time, not more.**

---

## 4. Proportionality Rule

Computational intensity must be proportional to:
- the consequence of the decision
- the system’s risk level
- the expected lifespan of the output

Design objectives:
- minimize number of invocations
- minimize model size
- maximize output longevity

Maximum intelligence without proportionality is a **design failure**.

---

## 5. Guilt Neutrality

M-OS-R does **not** use guilt as a control mechanism.

Guilt:
- paralyzes
- moralizes
- replaces analysis with affect

The system governs through:
- explicit constraints
- clear thresholds
- enforced decommissioning

Responsibility replaces guilt.

---

## 6. Sunset Clause

The long-term objective of M-OS-R is:
- to reduce AI to low-energy logistical support **or**
- to fully phase out AI once collective human intelligence suffices

No AI component is considered permanent.

Every AI-dependent module must include:
- exit criteria
- replacement strategies
- human fallback paths

---

## 7. Systemic Commitment

M-OS-R acknowledges that:

> AI in its current form is not ecologically sustainable at global scale.

Therefore, AI is used **only** when its use:
- contributes to its own future irrelevance
- reduces total system debt over time

All other uses are treated as **resource leakage**.
