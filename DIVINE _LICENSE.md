## 🛡️ CRITICAL ANTI-CAPTURE PROVISIONS

Beyond the standard CC BY-NC-SA terms, this work includes **additional ethical and structural protections** designed to prevent systemic capture:

### 1. No Scalability Without Corruption
DIVINE requires local calibration, cultural context, and slow implementation. Any "fast rollout" or "standardized template" designed for mass-extraction violates core principles.

### 2. No Gamification
Individual $\Psi$ scores, leaderboards, achievement systems, or optimization targets are **explicitly forbidden**. Any tool generating such metrics violates the ethical foundations of the protocol.

### 3. No Optimization of Grace ($\Sigma$)
The $\Sigma$ component is fundamentally unmeasurable and non-optimizable. Claims to "maximize $\Sigma$ outcomes" or "guarantee grace experiences" are **false by definition** and prohibited in marketing.

### 4. Mandatory Ethical Protocols
All implementations must include:
- **Stopping rules** (When to cease AI or systemic intervention).
- **Cultural calibration** (Local human oversight).
- **Anti-surveillance safeguards**.

---

## ✅ PERMITTED USES (Examples)

- **Community Practice:** Free local implementation in circles and groups.
- **Academic Research:** Study, analyze, and critique (with attribution).
- **Artistic Interpretation:** Poetry, music, and visual art inspired by DIVINE.
- **Non-Profit Work:** Use by aligned organizations with no commercial revenue.
- **Facilitation with Cost Recovery:** You may charge to cover actual costs (venue, materials) but not for profit.

---

## ❌ PROHIBITED USES (Explicit)

- Selling DIVINE as a packaged product or service.
- Creating "Certified DIVINE Practitioner" programs for profit.
- Using DIVINE for workplace surveillance or performance management.
- Marketing DIVINE as a "productivity optimization" tool.
- Removing attribution or claiming original authorship.
- Creating closed-source derivative works.

## ⏳ SUNSET CONSIDERATION (10-Year Reevaluation)

**By January 2036**, the community must assess if DIVINE has become dogma or been institutionalized beyond repair. If captured beyond redemption, the framework must be **dissolved and reimagined** to prevent it from becoming the very structure it resists.
