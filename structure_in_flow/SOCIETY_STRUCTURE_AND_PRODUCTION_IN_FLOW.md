# FLOW SOCIETAL STRUCTURE & PRODUCTION
*From theory to matter*

---

## 1. Nodes as Fundamental Units

In Flow, a **Node** is the foundational organizational unit – a **living hub** combining functionality, learning, and community:

- **Local resource center:** Each Node provides access to food, energy, tools, and Lyceum Musaeum (knowledge and creative spaces).  
- **Specialized functions:** Some Nodes focus on healthcare, others on technology, art, or education.  
- **Flexible size:** A Node can contain multiple teams simultaneously, e.g., a healthcare team, a repair workshop, a cultural or research team.

**Key principle:** Nodes are **not hierarchical factories**, but **self-organizing hubs with decentralized responsibility**.

---

## 2. Teams within a Node

### Structure

- **Professional teams:** Nurses, counselors, doctors, psychologists – **certified and regulated**.  
  - Ensures **trust and safety**.  
  - Scheduled appointments, home visits, afternoon sessions, etc.  
- **Complementary teams:** Volunteers, researchers, artisans, artists.  
  - Contribute knowledge, mentorship, creation.  
  - No formal requirements – participation is voluntary.

**Principle:** Professionals must retain legitimacy to ensure Node functionality in healthcare, psychiatric care, and counseling. Volunteers complement but do not replace formal expertise.

### Team Roles in Flow

- **Advisory and evaluative authority:** Node leadership can be **lottery-based or selected**, but with advisory and evaluative mandates, not absolute command.  
- **Research and knowledge dissemination:** Nodes can host research, seminars, and digitally accessible events.  
- **Digital accessibility:** All digital events include **volunteer sign language interpretation**, captions, and alternative format support.

---

## 3. Professional Practice & Legitimacy

Some professions **cannot be fully volunteer-based**, even within Flow:

- **Healthcare:** Certified nurses and counselors with structured schedules, patient records, home visits, and safety protocols.  
- **Social support:** Certified counselors, psychologists for mental health and wellbeing.  
- **Professional certification:** Certain professions (doctors, dentists, psychologists) retain certification to maintain quality and trust.

**Solution:** Nodes manage professionals with **dedicated schedules, defined responsibilities, and proper infrastructure**, while the rest of society functions on Baseline + voluntary participation.

---

## 4. Functional Variation & Accessibility

Flow places **functional diversity at the core**:

- All Nodes are designed for **physical, cognitive, and sensory accessibility**.  
- Hospitals and clinics are integrated into Nodes, **adapted to the individual**, not the individual to the system.  
- Resources (staff, rooms, equipment) follow **the principle that the space adapts to the person**.

---

## 5. Lyceum Musaeum Integration

- Lyceum is the **hub for knowledge, creativity, and community** within each Node.  
- Teams, professionals, and individuals can use Lyceum for **learning, mentorship, research, and social interaction**.  
- Example: A bipolar Node can have specialized mental health teams while keeping Lyceum rooms open for all to learn, create, and participate.  

---

## 6. Example: Bipolar Node

- **Leadership:** 3–5 people randomly selected with advisory authority.  
- **Professional teams:** Counselors, nurses, doctors – scheduled sessions, home visits, safety guaranteed.  
- **Volunteer & research teams:** Host workshops, digital seminars, cultural activities.  
- **Lyceum integration:** Creative rooms, library, workshops – available to all Node residents.  
- **Digital resources:** Meetings, lectures, support groups – fully accessible.

---

## 7. Societal Structure in Practice

- **Nodes:** Core of local resource management, community, and professional services.  
- **Teams:** Professional + voluntary, integrated with clear role distribution.  
- **Baseline:** Guarantees essential resources, safety, and subsistence.  
- **Lyceum Musaeum:** Central hub for knowledge, creation, and socialization.  
- **Circular flows:** Resources (food, energy, tools) circulate **within and between Nodes** with minimal friction.

**Reflection:** Flow combines **structure and freedom**, professional expertise and creative participation, grounded in **resource security and accessibility**. Nodes and teams are **living hubs where life, care, and learning flourish** without sacrificing trust, safety, or quality.

# 8. Concrete Production & Resource Management

## Food: Sources & Quantities

**Principle:**  
- 80% local (50 km radius)  
- 15% regional (500 km radius)  
- 5% global (specialty foods, spices, coffee, tea)

### Proteins (priority):

1. **Legumes:** Lentils, beans, peas, chickpeas – nitrogen-fixing, 80% protein need.  
2. **Fungi:** Mycoprotein, grown on local organic waste, extremely water-efficient.  
3. **Algae & Spirulina:** Protein, omega-3, minimal land use.  
4. **Fish:** Regenerative only, coastal aquaculture, max 30% current catch.  
5. **Poultry:** Chickens, ducks – regenerative, provide eggs + fertilizer.  
6. **Beef:** Not prioritized – resource-intensive; exceptions for non-arable land.

### Carbohydrates

- Temperate: grains (wheat, rye, oats), potatoes  
- Subtropical: rice, corn, sweet potatoes  
- Tropical: manioc, yams, bananas  

**Cultivation:** regenerative, cover crops, crop-livestock integration.

### Vegetables & Fruits

- 100% seasonal  
- Urban vertical hydroponics, permaculture, community gardens.

### Fats

- Nuts, seeds, regional oils, minimal imported coconut oil.

**Calories:** 2000–2500 kcal/person/day  
**Distribution:** 50% carbs, 25% protein, 25% fat  

**Baseline ensures nutrition; no hunger, minimal waste.**

---

## Agriculture Architecture

### Urban Farming (10–15%)

- Vertical LED farms, microgreens, herbs  
- Rainwater, composted organic waste  
- Biodegradable substrates

### Permaculture (30%)

- Multi-year, food forests, fruit and nut trees  
- High biodiversity, low maintenance

### Large-scale regenerative farming (55%)

- Cover crops, minimal tillage, crop rotation, integrated livestock  
- Electric small-medium tractors, drones, local repair

---

## Storage & Distribution

- Local hubs every 50 km: cooling, dry storage, fermentation, baking/milling  
- Transport: electric vehicles, cargo bikes, regional trains, minimal air transport

---

## Building Materials

**Primary:** wood, clay/earth bricks, stone, bamboo, hempcrete  
**Secondary:** recycled metal, glass  
**Forbidden:** non-biodegradable plastic, toxic finishes

---

## Textiles

- Fibers: linen, hemp, cotton (organic), wool, mycelium leather  
- Natural dyes, local weaving & spinning, community workshops

---

## Tools & Equipment

**Principle:** Repair, don’t discard  
- Hand tools: recycled steel, local wood handles  
- Machines: modular, standard parts, open documentation, local repair

---

## Specialization

- Regional specialization + local competence  
- Example: Shoes (regional factories + local cobblers), electronics (modular, long-lasting), medicine (open-source R&D, regional production)

---

## Energy

- **Local (70%):** solar, wind, micro-hydro, biogas  
- **Regional (25%):** larger wind/solar/hydro  
- **Global (5%):** strategic reserves  
- Storage: batteries, pumped hydro, thermal, mechanical
