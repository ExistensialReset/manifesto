# NO CURRENCY – DIRECT RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN FLOW

---

## Why it makes sense

Money was created to solve **resource exchange over time and distance**.  
In Flow:

- Baseline guarantees essentials
- Production is local/regional
- Nodes coordinate resources directly
- Lyceum provides tools and knowledge

**Result:** Currency is unnecessary.

## How it works

### 1. BASELINE – Automatic Access

- Food, housing, energy, healthcare, tools
- No application or bureaucracy
- Residents access resources freely

### 2. WORK – Contribution, not salary

- Motivation: meaning, mastery, curiosity, social connection
- Example: doctors help because they want to help; craftsmen create because they love it

### 3. SPECIALIZATION – Regional Coordination Without Currency

- Local: Craftspeople repair and produce for community
- Regional: Factories produce basic goods, distributed to Nodes
- Social recognition replaces economic incentives

### 4. REGIONAL & GLOBAL RESOURCE EXCHANGE

- 15% regional, 5% global
- Direct exchange of goods tracked by Nodes
- Example: Node A sends wine, Node B sends bread, Node C sends fish
- Global: Coffee, tea, spices, rare minerals exchanged under reciprocity

### 5. PROFESSIONAL TEAMS

- Doctors, nurses, therapists work for **status + meaning**, not money
- Education is free; contribution is voluntary
- Peer review ensures quality

### 6. QUALITY CONTROL

- Certification for professionals
- Reputation and social recognition for artisans
- Rotation and reassignment for underperforming professionals

### 7. NON-PARTICIPATION

- Baseline still available
- Social encouragement promotes engagement
- Soft, non-coercive pressure over time
