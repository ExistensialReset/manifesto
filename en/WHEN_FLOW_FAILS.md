## The Spjuver’s Warning
This document is not a footnote. It is the architectural anchor of M-OS-R. We acknowledge that Flow is an experiment, and like all living things, it faces the risk of decay, corruption, and collapse.

### 1. The Capacity-Mirage (The Resource Trap)
**The Risk:** What if the 1.62x surplus is a statistical ghost?
**Spjuver’s Question:** What happens in São Paulo when the surgeon has no insulin? If the surplus vanishes, does Flow turn into a "hunger games" of empathy?
**Failure Mode:** Flow collapses into chaos because it never learned to manage actual scarcity without debt.

### 2. The Free-Rider Cascade (The Maintenance Trap)
**The Risk:** If meaning is the only driver, who cleans the sewers?
**Spjuver’s Question:** If 40% of the population finds "meaning" in art while the infrastructure rots, does the system force people to work? (If yes: Flow is dead. If no: The people die).
**Failure Mode:** Decay of critical life-support systems.

### 3. The Prophet Problem (The Founder’s Shadow)
**The Risk:** Elinor Frejd becomes the accidental deity of a new dogma.
**Spjuver’s Question:** If someone fundamentally rejects Flow, are they "un-resonant"? How do we prevent a "Flow-elite" from forming around those who speak the language of the Architect best?
**Failure Mode:** Cult dynamics disguised as liberation.

### 4. Meaning-Privilege (The Lagos Dilemma)
**The Risk:** Flow is a luxury for those whose bellies are full.
**Spjuver’s Question:** Is Flow relevant to a mother in Lagos with three jobs? Or is it just another Western ivory-tower fantasy?
**Failure Mode:** The system becomes an "enlightened bubble" that fails the global majority.

## The Trolley Problems of Flow
* **The Stockpiler:** A person hoards resources due to past trauma (Mammon-PTSD). Do we take it by force (Violating L) or let them endanger the collective (Violating I)?
* **The Desirable Resource:** 500 people want 100 apartments in Stockholm. If we use an algorithm, we lose Empathy. If we use people, we invite Corruption. 

## Exit Protocols: The Right to Defect
True sovereignty includes the right to be "un-sovereign." Anyone can leave. 
**The Dilemma:** Can you leave Flow but still use the pipes, the roads, and the air that Flow maintains? If we exclude you, we are Mammon. If we don't, we are being exploited.

## Open Questions (The Honest Unknowns)
1. How do we measure "Existential Stability" without a surveillance state?
2. Can Flow survive a deliberate, coordinated attack by Mammon-holdouts?
3. What is the actual "Point of No Return" where we must abort the mission?
