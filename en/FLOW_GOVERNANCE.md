# FLOW_GOVERNANCE.md: Decision Processes in a Flow System

M-OS-R replaces hierarchical power with logical resonance. We do not rule through coercion, but by optimizing the flow equation.

## 1. From Majority Rule to Consent
We do not use voting where a majority oppresses a minority. We use **Consent**:
* A proposal is approved if no one can present a logical objection showing that the proposal harms system stability (L), creativity (S), or inclusion (I).

## 2. Holoptic Transparency
Decisions require symmetric information. Every node has the right to full insight into the data underlying a decision. When the truth is visible to all, the logical decision often becomes self-evident.

## 3. SRS-Based Expertise
Nodes with documented resonance (high SRS) within a specific domain act as guides. They hold no formal power, but their logical contributions carry weight because they have proven their ability to facilitate flow.

## 4. Conflict Resolution: The Resonance Test
In case of disagreement, options are run through the equation:
**Life = L × S × I**
The option that mathematically maximizes the value for the most nodes takes precedence.
