# LOGISTIC_PROOFS.md: Proof that Scarcity is a Construction

This document proves that the current system (Mammon) is logistically defective and that M-OS-R is the natural, logical successor.

## 1. The Caloric Flow: Food Waste vs. Hunger
* **Fact:** 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted annually. 800 million people suffer from hunger.
* **Proof:** The problem is distribution, not production. Scarcity is a choice made by market logic.
* **M-OS-R Solution:** Direct logistics to secure the Guaranteed Baseline (L).

## 2. Housing Logic: Investment vs. Shelter
* **Fact:** The number of empty "investment properties" exceeds the number of homeless individuals in most major Western cities.
* **Proof:** Housing is used as a financial instrument rather than shelter (L). This is a logical waste of existing infrastructure.
* **M-OS-R Solution:** Prioritizing the right of use for sovereign nodes over speculative fiction.

## 3. The Automation Dividend: Time vs. Debt
* **Fact:** Productivity has exploded since 1970, yet working hours remain static.
* **Proof:** The efficiency gains have been consumed by interest on fictitious debt. We work to feed an algorithm, not to live.
* **M-OS-R Solution:** Trading technical efficiency for Spontaneity (S) and Calm (L).

## 4. The Energy Paradox: Fossil Subsidies
* **Fact:** $7 trillion in annual subsidies for fossil fuels.
* **Proof:** The system actively pays to maintain artificial energy scarcity and control.
* **M-OS-R Solution:** Energy as part of the guaranteed baseline through decentralized flow.
