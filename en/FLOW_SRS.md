# FLOW_SRS.md: Social Resonance Logic (SRS)

When the debt-fiction (Mammon) is erased, a logistical signal is required to direct resources without coercion or centralized control. We introduce SRS.

## 1. Definition: What is SRS?
SRS is not money. It is a logistical **gratitude signal**. It measures a node's ability to increase the total flow ($L \times S \times I$) within the system.

## 2. The Equation for SRS Generation
A node's SRS value ($V_{srs}$) is generated when they facilitate flow for another:
$$V_{srs} = \sum (L_{facilitated} + S_{inspired} + I_{connected})$$

* **L-contribution:** Creating security for others (e.g., infrastructure maintenance).
* **S-contribution:** Inspiring new creative power (e.g., open source code or art).
* **I-contribution:** Connecting nodes that create synergy.

## 3. Safeguards Against Power Concentration (Anti-Mammon Filters)
* **Half-life Decay:** SRS has a natural half-life. If you stop contributing to the flow, your signal gradually decays. This prevents the static accumulation of power.
* **Non-tradable:** You cannot buy or sell SRS. It can only be *earned* through genuine recognition from other nodes.
* **Guaranteed Baseline:** Your existence (70%) is never conditional on your SRS score. SRS only grants priority access to the 30% buffer (specialized resources, advanced technology, strategic influence).
