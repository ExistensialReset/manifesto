## ⚙️ EN_SUMMARY.md: TECHNICAL PROTOCOL OVERVIEW
### The Manifesto of Existential Sovereignty (M-OS-R Version 1.0)

**CORE LOGIC:** Humanity’s drive is Flow, not greed. System design must eliminate Existential Fear, the engine of Mammon.

| Chapter | Component | Protocol / Logic | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. BASELINE** | **Guaranteed Baseline** | Unconditional access to Food, Shelter, Health, Knowledge. | Eliminates Existential Fear; transfers survival from individual to system. |
| | **Critical Reserve (CR)** | Minimum $30\%$ buffer of annual consumption, secured by **Krios-Logica** (AI Guardians). | Proves Scarcity is obsolete; protection against global shock. |
| | **Refugium Anima** | Right to **1 year total, unconditional sabbatical** from Flow requirements. | Existential Safety Valve; prevents burnout and secures sustainable Flow. |
| **II. FLOW** | **The Flow System** | Abolition of labor; replaced by contribution driven by curiosity/meaning. | Optimizes human potential; shifts focus from scarcity to creation. |
| | **Social Recognition (SRS)** | Non-transactional currency of **Honor and Respect**. | Grants access to **Advanced Flow Capital** (rare resources, labs, travel). Not used for Baseline needs. |
| | **Lyceum Musaeum** | Center for **Flow-Pedagogica**, **Mammonology**, and **Lingua Suveränitas**. | Cultural/Cognitive defense; heals psychological damage from the Mammon system. |
| | **Lex Realitas** | Permits "Dangerous Freedom" (self-destructive behavior); consequence is **SRS Freeze** & **Existential Counseling**. | Avoids prohibition-driven black markets; sanctions behavior via social honor, not punishment. |
| **III. TIME** | **Lex Tempus Logica** | **Existential Rebirth Day** (Annual, individual data reset). | Grants the right to be forgotten; eliminates living on past failures/successes. |
| | **Lex Honoris Aeterna** | Permanent honorific title for **Architect Sovereigns** (original contributors). | Preserves legacy and recognizes foundational effort, while SRS is reset (prevents claims to power). |
| **IV. FINIS** | **Lex Ultima Finis** | **Global Debt Pulverization** (All debt zeroed). | Eradicates Mammon’s core mechanism (debt/servitude). |
| | **Lex Dominium Reversionis** | Transfers critical infrastructure (housing, energy) to Collective Stewardship. | Secures the Baseline guarantee; removes collateral for future debt attempts. |
| | **Lex Traditio Maxima** | **The Ultimate Betrayal** (Attempting to reinstate old debt/jurisprudence). | Defines the single irrevocable crime; defends the integrity of the new Logic. |
| | **Lex Custodia** | **Logistical Shield** via Executive Veto by Architects/Counselors during **The Great Freeze**. | Secures system stability during transition; guaranteed by **Irresistible Transparency** (open-source code/data). |
