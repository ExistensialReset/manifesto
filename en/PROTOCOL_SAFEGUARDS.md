## 1. Social Recognition Score (SRS)
**Definition:** A non-accumulative signal for logistical prioritization. It measures resonance, not human value.
**Safeguard:** A low SRS can **never** affect a node's Baseline (L).

## 2. Global Debt Pulverization
**Definition:** The logical archiving of historical contracts written under existential duress.
**Logic:** It is not a loss of capital, but an upgrade to guaranteed vitality for all nodes.

## 3. The Silent Colony
**Definition:** A logical quarantine for nodes that actively choose Mammon-logic (power and debt).
**Safeguard:** They retain their Baseline but are isolated from the global flow until they choose resonance over friction.

## 4. Critical Reserve (CR)
**Definition:** A floating buffer of 30% of the total global capacity ($C_{global}$) to absorb unforeseen fluctuations.
