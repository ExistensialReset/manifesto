# LYCEUM_MUSAEUM.md (Principles of Knowledge and Play)

## I. The Sacred Mistake
Mistakes are celebrated as necessary friction for discovery. No punishment, only exploration.

## II. Play as Activity
Being playful is high-frequency spontaneity and innovation, not passivity. Utility is a byproduct of play.

## III. Boundless Knowledge Exploration
All gathered human knowledge is frictionlessly accessible. Knowledge is not owned; it is shared to increase the system's total resonance.

## IV. Language and Cognition
Development of new languages and concepts to free cognition from "debt-language" (Mammon-linguistics).

## V. Mammonology
The scientific study of the old system's pathology to prevent its return.

## VI. The Gentle Re-entry
A place for healing. One is allowed to observe until spontaneity awakens. No requirement for participation.
