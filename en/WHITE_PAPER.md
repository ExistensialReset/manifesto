# WHITE PAPER: EXISTENTIAL SOVEREIGNTY (M-OS-R)

## The Existential Equation
**Life = L × S × I**
* **L (Lucidity/Calm):** Guaranteed Baseline.
* **S (Spontaneity):** Right to play and explore.
* **I (Inclusion/Empathy):** Synergistic resonance.

## Summary
M-OS-R is an operating system for human sovereignty. By guaranteeing the Baseline, erasing debt, and enabling free knowledge exploration via Lyceum Musaeum, we move humanity from survival to Flow.

**"Human beings should not have to earn the right to exist."**
