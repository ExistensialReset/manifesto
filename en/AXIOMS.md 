# AXIOMS.md (Fundamental Logic of Existential Sovereignty)

This manifesto rests upon five non-negotiable axioms that form the basis for the protocol's logical functionality.

## AXIOM 1: Lex Necessitas (The Necessity of Existence)
**Definition:** Existence is a logical necessity, not a privilege conditioned by performance. All life has the right to an inviolable **Guaranteed Baseline** of resources, protection, and health.
**Logical Conclusion:** Existential fear is a systemic attack. This axiom forms the basis for the **30% Critical Reserve (CR)**.

## AXIOM 2: Lex Logica Finis (The Logical End of Scarcity)
**Definition:** Scarcity is a logistical failure and a manufactured state for power control. Resource distribution is a solvable engineering problem.
**Logical Conclusion:** The Critical Reserve is the mathematical minimum required to make it logically impossible to maintain scarcity.

## AXIOM 3: Lex Dualis Veritas (Irresistible Transparency)
**Definition:** Truth must be proven through code and verifiable public protocols, not through centralized authority.
**Logical Conclusion:** M-OS-R operates under irresistible transparency. Find the error in the code, or accept the logic.

## AXIOM 4: Lex Flow (The Sovereignty of Drive)
**Definition:** The primary human drive is not greed, but the innate desire to create and find meaning (**Flow**).
**Logical Conclusion:** The **Social Recognition Score (SRS)** replaces currency to regulate access to complex resources and rewards contributions to the flow.

## AXIOM 5: Lex Ultima Finis (The Final Logical Conclusion)
**Definition:** All systems built on permanent debt or engineered scarcity (Mammon) are logically defective and must be archived once M-OS-R has been validated.
**Logical Conclusion:** The manifesto initiates a **Global Debt Pulverization** and resets the system to the Baseline.
