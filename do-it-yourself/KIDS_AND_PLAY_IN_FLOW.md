## PREAMBLE: Speaking with Children about Big Things

Children understand more than we think. They sense when we are authentic. They notice when we try to oversimplify. They live in a world where the boundary between fantasy and reality is fluid—just like in Flow.

This document is not a curriculum. It is a reminder: **Play is the most serious thing we do.** It is in play that we explore, test boundaries, feel our way, and learn what it means to be human.

## §1. CALM (L) – Being a Still Frog

**Explanation for Kids:**
Calm is when the body feels safe. When the heart beats slowly. When thoughts aren't bouncing around like rubber balls. Calm is like a still lake where you can see all the way to the bottom.

**Games and Exercises:**
* **The Resting Frog:** Lie on the floor, close your eyes, and pretend to be a frog sunbathing on a rock. Feel your belly move as you breathe. Count to ten slowly.
* **The Sound Journey:** Sit quietly for one minute and listen. What sounds do you hear? Birds, wind, a car far away? Afterward, draw what you heard.

## §2. SPONTANEITY (S) – A Jumping Stream

**Explanation for Kids:**
Spontaneity is when you do something without planning. When you just do it because it feels right in the moment. Like a stream jumping over rocks—it doesn't know the exact path, but it finds its way.

**Games and Exercises:**
* **Yes, and...:** A game where one person says something, and the next person must start with "Yes, and..." and continue the story. No "no’s," no objections—just play.
* **Building with Clay or Blocks:** Give the children materials but no instructions. See what happens. Ask them to tell the story of their creation.

## §3. EMPATHY / SENSING (I) – The Tree Roots

**Explanation for Kids:**
Empathy is feeling what others feel. Just like trees in the forest have roots that are intertwined and can share water and nutrients, we can share feelings. When someone is sad, you feel it in your belly. When someone is happy, you feel happy too.

**Games and Exercises:**
* **Emotion Charades:** One person shows an emotion without words (happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared). The others guess. Talk about how you could tell it was that specific feeling.
* **The Compass Game:** One person closes their eyes. Another person leads them through the room by just touching their shoulder lightly. Switch roles. Feel what it’s like to trust someone.

## §4. ETERNAL WISDOM (EV) – The Old Oak

**Explanation for Kids:**
Eternal Wisdom is everything that has existed for a long time and knows things we might have forgotten. An old oak has stood through many storms. It knows how to survive. We can learn from it, from elders, and from nature.

**Games and Exercises:**
* **Plant a Tree:** Plant a tree together and talk about what it will experience during its life. Who will sit in its shadow? This is an exercise in thinking in generations.
* **Storytime with an Elder:** Invite an elder to tell stories about what it was like when they were small. What has changed? What is the same?

## §5. RESILIENCE (R) – The Dandelion in the Asphalt

**Explanation for Kids:**
Resilience is when something breaks or becomes difficult, and you can still come back. Like a dandelion growing through a crack in the pavement. It is strong because it adapts.

**Games and Exercises:**
* **Build and Topple:** Build towers of blocks or sticks. Knock them down on purpose. Rebuild them—perhaps in a new way. Talk about how it feels when something collapses.
* **Repairing Things:** Take a broken toy or garment. Fix it together. Sew, tape, glue. Celebrate that it became whole again, even if it doesn't look new.

## §6. COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE (K) – The Ant Hill

**Explanation for Kids:**
Collective intelligence is when many people together can do things that no one can do alone. Like ants building a massive hill—no single ant has the blueprint, but together they create something amazing.

**Games and Exercises:**
* **Build a Hut Together:** Use branches, fabrics, whatever is available. Everyone must contribute. Afterward, ask: How did you know what to do? Did you need a leader?
* **Group Riddle:** Give the group a puzzle that requires cooperation. Let them talk and try. Celebrate the shared solution.

## §7. WONDER (F) – Seeing the World for the First Time

**Explanation for Kids:**
Wonder is when you become completely fascinated by something. When you forget time and space because something is so beautiful, strange, or exciting.

**Games and Exercises:**
* **Explore with a Magnifying Glass:** Look at tiny things—a flower, an insect, a grain of sand. What do you see that you never noticed before?
* **The Wonder Walk:** Take a walk where everyone gets to stop whenever they see something that fascinates them. Show each other. Nothing is too small or too silly.

## CONCLUSION: Play in Progress

The most important thing: **There is no right way to play.** Play is its own purpose. If an exercise doesn't work, let it go. If the children want to do something else, follow them.

And remember: the adults in the room are also children, just older. Let them join in and play. They need it at least as much.
