# 🔧 THE REPAIR MANIFESTO: Fixing as Resistance

**Status:** POLITICAL & PRACTICAL GUIDE  
**Core Principle:** Every repair is a small revolution  
**Motto:** "Allt som kan lagas är plus" (Everything that can be fixed is plus)

## PREAMBLE: WHY REPAIR MATTERS

Mammon wants you to throw away and buy new.

Why?

Because:

* Planned obsolescence creates endless demand
* "New" feels like progress (it's not)
* Repairing requires skill (they want you dependent)
* Fixing things makes you less afraid
* It disconnects you from the cycle of endless extraction from Earth's resources

When you repair:

You say:

* "I don't need new"
* "I can learn"
* "I am capable"
* "I refuse to feed you, Mammon"
* "I honor the Earth's rhythms by extending life cycles"

Every repair is refusal.

Every fixed thing is freedom.

And in the spirit of Existential Reset, repair resets your relationship with the material world—shifting from consumption to creation, from dependency to sovereignty.

## PART I: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF REPAIR

### Why We Don't Repair (And How to Start Anyway)

**"I'm not good enough"**

**The lie:** Only experts can fix things.

**The truth:** Most repairs are simple. You just haven't tried yet. Skills build through trial and error, fostering resilience.

**The antidote:** Start with something broken that you don't care about. If you break it more, nothing is lost. If you fix it – you learned. Track your progress in a repair journal to build confidence over time.

---

**"I don't have tools"**

**The lie:** You need expensive tools to repair.

**The truth:** Most basic repairs need: screwdriver, pliers, duct tape, glue. Many communities offer free access.

**The antidote:** Borrow tools. Join tool library. Buy one tool at a time when needed. Consider second-hand markets or online swaps to avoid feeding new production.

---

**"It's faster to buy new"**

**The lie:** Time is money.

**The truth:** Time spent learning is investment. Next time it's faster. Plus, the environmental cost of "new" far outweighs your time.

**The antidote:** Repair is meditation. Slow down. Enjoy the process. Frame it as a deliberate act of Flow—where spontaneity meets focus, leading to deeper satisfaction.

---

**"New is better"**

**The lie:** New things are higher quality.

**The truth:** Old things were often built better. New things are designed to break. Repairing preserves quality and reduces e-waste.

**The antidote:** See the beauty in worn things. Scars tell stories. Embrace wabi-sabi: the aesthetic of impermanence and imperfection.

---

**"It's not safe"**

**The lie:** Repairing could be dangerous, especially with electronics or machinery.

**The truth:** With basic precautions, most repairs are safe. Ignorance breeds fear, but knowledge empowers.

**The antidote:** Always unplug devices before working. Wear safety gear like gloves and goggles. Research hazards first—many guides include safety notes. If unsure, consult a pro, but use it as a learning opportunity.

---

**"I don't know where to start"**

**The lie:** You need a formal course or certification to begin.

**The truth:** Every expert started as a beginner. The first step is simply to look closely at the broken item and ask, "What's wrong?"

**The antidote:** Adopt the "Five-Minute Rule": Commit to examining the broken item for just five minutes. Often, the problem reveals itself, and the next step becomes clear. Use the "One Thing" principle from the Existential Reset—focus on the single, smallest actionable step.

---

---

## PART IV: THE REPAIR TOOLKIT

You don't need everything. Start here:

### BASIC KIT (~50€ total):

**Tools:**
* Multi-bit screwdriver
* Pliers (regular + needle-nose)
* Adjustable wrench
* Duct tape
* Super glue
* Sewing kit (needle, thread, scissors)

This covers 80% of household repairs.

---

### INTERMEDIATE KIT (~150€ more):

* Drill (cordless)
* Saw (hand saw)
* Hammer
* Measuring tape
* Sandpaper (various grits)
* Soldering iron (for electronics)
* Multimeter (for testing circuits)

Now you can fix almost anything non-specialized.

---

### ADVANCED KIT (acquire over time):

* Power sander
* Circular saw
* Jigsaw
* Angle grinder (for metal)
* Oscillating multi-tool
* Bike repair stand
* Specialized tools as needed
* 3D printer (for custom parts)

But honestly? Most people never need this.

**Sourcing Tip:** Prioritize second-hand tools from flea markets or apps like Freecycle to minimize environmental impact. Organize tools with a shadow board or labeled bins to maintain the "Lugn" (calm) of an orderly workspace.

**Tool Maintenance:** Clean, oil, and sharpen your tools regularly. A well-maintained tool is safer, more effective, and lasts generations—embodying the manifesto's core principle.

---

## PART V: THE KINTSUGI PRINCIPLE

**Kintsugi:** Japanese art of repairing pottery with gold.

**The philosophy:**

Breakage is part of history. Repair with honor, not shame.

**In practice:**

Don't hide repairs.
Celebrate them.

* Patch jeans with colorful fabric
* Glue chair with visible wood fill
* Sew buttons that don't match
* Use contrasting thread for stitches

Imperfection is beautiful. Scars tell stories.

Your repaired things say:

> "I was broken. I was fixed. I am still here."

That's powerful.

**Tie to Core Resonance:** This embodies L (Lugn – Calm acceptance of flaws), S (Spontaneity in creative fixes), and I (Inkännande – Empathy for the object's "life" and Earth's materials).

**Expand the Metaphor:** Apply Kintsugi beyond objects—to relationships, communities, and personal healing. Repair as a holistic practice.

---

## PART VI: BUILDING A REPAIR CIRCLE

Repairing alone is good. Repairing together is better.

---

### HOW TO START A REPAIR CIRCLE:

**Step 1: Find 2-5 people**

Ask:
* Friends
* Neighbors
* Online local groups
* Colleagues with shared values

*"Want to fix stuff together instead of throwing it away?"*

**Digital Outreach:** Use apps like Nextdoor or Reddit local subs to recruit. Create a simple signal group or Discord server for coordination.

---

**Step 2: Pick a time/place**
* Someone's garage
* Community center
* Library meeting room
* Park (if weather good)
* Local makerspace (often have open nights)

Once a month to start.

**Virtual Option:** Host online sessions via video for software/digital repairs. Use screen-sharing for collaborative troubleshooting.

---

**Step 3: Share tools & skills inventory**

Everyone brings what they have.

Create shared inventory:
* Who has what tools
* Who knows what skills (sewing, electronics, wood, code)
* Use a shared spreadsheet or app like Notion

**Skill-Barter System:** Trade repair hours—you fix my bike, I'll hem your pants. Formalize the local economy of care.

---

**Step 4: Bring broken things**

Each person brings 1-2 things to fix.

**Rules:**
* No judgment if you can't fix it
* No pressure to succeed
* Celebrate attempts
* Prioritize safety

---

**Step 5: Teach each other**

Person who knows bikes → teaches others
Person who knows sewing → teaches others
Person who knows coding → teaches others

Knowledge multiplies.

**Inclusivity:** Ensure diverse skills—include tech, eco, and cultural repair traditions. Actively invite people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds.

---

**Step 6: Document & amplify**

Take photos.
Write down what worked.
Share online (if you want).
Create a local "Fixed It!" gallery on social media.

Inspire others.

**Scale Up:** Turn successes into open-source guides on GitHub or wikis. Partner with local schools or clubs to host workshops.

---

## PART VII: WHEN REPAIR ISN'T POSSIBLE

Sometimes things are truly dead.

That's okay.

But before giving up:

**Ask:**

1. Can this be parts for something else?
2. Can someone else use this (even broken)?
3. Can this be raw material (wood, metal, fabric)?
4. Is there a modular upgrade path?
5. Can it be artistically transformed?

**Disposal hierarchy:**

1. Repair
2. Repurpose / Upcycle
3. Cannibalize for parts
4. Give away / Donate for parts
5. Recycle properly
6. Trash (last resort)

**Eco-Check:** Research local e-waste programs to ensure responsible recycling, avoiding export to harmful dumps. Use databases like ewasteguide.info or recyclenow.com.

**Post-Mortem Analysis:** Conduct a "failure autopsy." Why did it die? Was it planned obsolescence? A cheap part? Document the cause to inform future purchases and advocacy.

---

## PART VIII: THE POLITICAL ACT

Every repair is political.

Because:

When you fix instead of buy:

* Corporations lose a sale
* Planned obsolescence loses power
* You gain confidence
* You reduce waste
* You resist Mammon
* You support "Right to Repair" movements globally
* You reduce carbon emissions

**Multiply this by millions:**

Imagine:

* 1 million people repair instead of replace
* Corporations lose billions
* Landfills shrink
* Skills return
* Communities strengthen
* Carbon emissions drop (e.g., manufacturing one smartphone emits 50-80kg CO2)
* A cultural shift from ownership to stewardship emerges

This is revolution.

Not loud. Not violent.

Just:

Millions of people quietly saying:

> "No. I will not throw this away. I will fix it."

And Mammon starves.

**Advocacy Tip:** Join petitions for Right to Repair laws in your country—e.g., EU mandates or US bills—to make parts and manuals accessible. Support organizations like Repair.org and The Restart Project. Vote with your wallet for repairable products (e.g., Fairphone, Framework laptop).

**Corporate Pressure:** Use social media to @ companies when products break prematurely. Share your repair stories with hashtags like #RightToRepair. Collective noise gets attention.

---

## PART IX: REPAIR AS MEDITATION & MENTAL RESET

Fixing things slows you down.

This is good.

**In repair:**
* You cannot rush
* You must pay attention
* You must be present
* You must problem-solve

This is Flow (S – Spontaneity):

You are:
* Creative
* Focused
* Solving problems
* Not consuming

Your hands are busy. Your mind is calm.

This is the opposite of Mammon.

Mammon wants you:
* Anxious
* Consuming
* Distracted
* Helpless

Repair makes you:
* Calm
* Creating
* Focused
* Capable

**Existential Reset Connection:** Repair triggers a reset—realigning with L (baseline calm), S (spontaneous action), and I (empathy for all things). It's a micro-ritual for reclaiming agency in a chaotic world.

**Mental Health Boost:** Studies show hands-on activities reduce anxiety and build self-efficacy. The tangible completion of a repair provides a dopamine hit of accomplishment. Pair repair sessions with mindfulness techniques: breathe deeply when frustrated, celebrate small wins.

**Therapy Parallel:** Just as we repair objects, we can repair our psyches. The process mirrors therapeutic work: diagnose the issue, have patience, apply care, and integrate the "break" into a stronger whole.

---

## PART X: REPAIR AND THE CLIMATE – THE NUMBERS THAT MATTER

Every repair is a direct climate action. Here’s how:

**Carbon Saved:**
* Extending a laptop's life by 3 years avoids ~150kg CO2e (equivalent to a car trip from Stockholm to Copenhagen).
* Repairing and reusing a washing machine saves ~50% of the carbon footprint compared to buying new.
* The global repair movement could reduce e-waste by millions of tonnes annually—e-waste is a major source of toxic leakage and greenhouse gases when incinerated.

**Resource Conservation:**
* One repaired smartphone saves ~13,000 liters of water (used in mining and manufacturing).
* Mending clothes reduces demand for fast fashion, which accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions.

**Biodiversity Impact:**
* Reducing demand for new goods lessens deforestation, mining, and habitat destruction.
* Fewer products in landfills means less soil and water contamination.

**Actionable Climate Steps:**
1. **Calculate Your Repair Footprint:** Use online calculators to estimate CO2 saved per repair.
2. **Advocate for Repair-Friendly Policies:** Support legislation that mandates repairability indexes (like in France) and holds companies accountable for full life-cycle impact.
3. **Join the Circular Economy:** Prioritize buying repaired, refurbished, or repairable items. Support local repair businesses.
4. **Share the Data:** When you post a repair, include the estimated resources saved. Make the impact visible.

Remember: The most sustainable product is the one that already exists. Keeping it alive is a radical act of ecological defense.

---

## PART XI: THE FUTURE OF REPAIR – BEYOND THE OBJECT

Repair is evolving. Join the next wave.

**Open Source Everything:**
* Download 3D-printable repair parts from platforms like Thingiverse or Printables.
* Contribute your own designs to global commons.

**Modular & Hackable Design:**
* Support companies designing for disassembly (e.g., Framework laptops, Fairphones).
* Learn to modify and upgrade rather than replace.

**Digital Sovereignty:**
* Repair your digital life: clean up data, migrate from walled gardens to open-source platforms, fix outdated code.
* Run a personal "server" (like a Raspberry Pi) to control your data and services.

**Community Infrastructure:**
* Advocate for local "Repair Hubs" in every neighborhood, with tools, parts, and expertise.
* Push libraries to lend "things" (tools, kits, instruments) and offer repair workshops.

**Systemic Change:**
* Teach repair in schools as core curriculum alongside math and language.
* Integrate repair philosophy into business models and urban planning.

The Ultimate Vision: A world where repair is the default, waste is a design flaw, and our relationship with stuff is guided by care, not consumption.
