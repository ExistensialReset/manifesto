## If You Proceed Despite Warnings

**Harm reduction:**

1. Never work alone (someone sober must be present)
2. Test small batches first
3. Keep antidotes accessible (activated charcoal, etc.)
4. Document everything (for emergency responders)
5. Tell someone you trust what you're doing

**Your life matters even if you're taking risks.**
