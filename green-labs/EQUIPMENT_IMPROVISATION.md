# Equipment Substitutions for Emergency Conditions

## If You Don't Have a Glovebox:
- Use large clear plastic storage box
- Cut arm holes, tape on rubber gloves
- Spray interior with 70% ethanol
- Not perfect, but reduces contamination 60-70%

## If You Don't Have 0.001g Scale:
- Use volumetric dosing instead
- Dissolve known amount in known volume
- Measure liquid, not powder
- Example: 100mg lithium in 100ml water = 1mg/ml

## If You Don't Have Magnetic Stirrer:
- Manual stirring every 15 min (set timer)
- Or: Aquarium air pump + tubing (bubble agitation)
- Less efficient but functional
