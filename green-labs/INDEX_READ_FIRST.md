# 🌱 /green-labs — INDEX

**Status:** Witness Archive / Harm-Pressure Documentation  
**Domain:** Medicine Access Failure, Systemic Risk, Survival Knowledge  
**Warning Level:** High — Context Required Before Reading

---

## READ THIS FIRST

This directory contains **materials that exist because access to medicine is not guaranteed**.

The presence of medical recipes or formulations in this archive is **not an endorsement**.
It is evidence.

Evidence that people, when denied affordable and timely care, begin to document survival knowledge that should never have been their responsibility to carry.

---

## WHY THIS EXISTS

In large parts of the world, people cannot reliably access the medications they depend on.

- In the United States, there is **no national high-cost protection**.
- In other regions, shortages, patents, pricing, or gatekeeping create similar gaps.
- Even in countries with partial protection, cost ceilings can still exceed what many can pay.

When medicine becomes unaffordable, **people do not stop needing it**.
They look for other ways.

This directory exists to document that pressure.

## ABOUT THE CONTENT

Some files in this directory describe methods or formulations related to medication.

These materials:

- Were collected or written under conditions of **access failure**
- Reflect **individual survival contexts**, not universal safety
- Are **not standardized, regulated, or medically supervised**
- May be incomplete, unsafe, or unsuitable for other bodies

**Nothing here should be interpreted as medical advice.**

---

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

- This repository does **not** encourage anyone to manufacture, modify, or self-administer medication.
- No guarantee of safety, efficacy, or legality is made.
- Bodies are not interchangeable.
- What one person survives may seriously harm another.

If you have access to safe, regulated medical care: **use it**.

If you do not — that is a systemic failure, not an individual one.

---

## ETHICAL POSITION

Medicine should be infrastructure, not a market luxury.

A society in which people feel compelled to document how to make their own medication
has already crossed a moral failure threshold.

The long-term solution is:

- Universal baseline access
- Public or commons-based medicine production
- Removal of artificial scarcity where lives are at stake
- Treating health as non-negotiable

Until then, archives like this will continue to exist.

That is not radical.
It is diagnostic.

---

## RELATION TO M-OS-R / FLOW

/green-labs exists as:

- Evidence of **Baseline violation**
- Input to **Justice-as-Repair**
- Justification for **Debt Pulverization**
- A reminder of why Flow must remove survival coercion entirely

If Flow succeeds, this directory becomes obsolete.

That is the goal.

**This index does not legitimize the recipes.  
It documents the conditions that created them.**
