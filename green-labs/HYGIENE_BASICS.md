## Ⅰ. PRINCIPLES OF HYGIENE SOVEREIGNTY
In a Green Lab, hygiene is viewed as the primary defense for the body's largest organ: the skin. We reject industrial surfactants (like SLS) and focus on natural saponification and stable emulsions. We prioritize biocompatibility over shelf-life.

## Ⅱ. SOLID SOAP (The Foundation)
**Purpose:** General cleansing for body and hands.  
**Chemistry:** Fat + Lye (Base) = Soap + Glycerin.

### Ingredients:
1. **Fat:** 500g (e.g., olive oil, coconut oil, or local rapeseed oil).
2. **Lye:** Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH). *Note: Use a soap calculator to find the exact amount per fat type.*
3. **Liquid:** 150g Distilled water.

### Process:
1. **Lye Solution:** Add the lye to the water (NEVER the other way around!). It will generate heat. Let it cool.
2. **Mixing:** Warm your oils to approximately 40°C. Pour the lye solution into the oils.
3. **Agitation:** Use your **Magnetic Stirrer** or a stick blender until the mixture reaches "trace" (the thickness of pudding).
4. **Curing:** Pour into molds. Let sit for 24 hours. Cut into bars and let "cure" for 4-6 weeks to ensure the lye is fully neutralized.

## Ⅲ. SHAMPOO & SHOWER GEL (Liquid Form)
**Purpose:** Gentle cleansing without stripping natural oils.

### Methodology:
We either use Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) for liquid soap or dissolve grated solid soap into a strong herbal infusion.
- **Additives:** Honey or Aloe Vera for moisture.
- **For Shower Gel:** Superfat the recipe by 10% (add extra oil) to moisturize the skin during use.

## Ⅳ. CONDITIONER & MOISTURIZER (Emulsions)
**Purpose:** Forcing water and oil to bond to provide deep hydration. This is where your Magnetic Stirrer (The Fan) is essential.

### Ingredients for Moisturizer (Dry Skin Focus):
1. **Water Phase (70%):** Distilled water or floral hydrosols.
2. **Oil Phase (25%):** Shea butter, almond oil, or beeswax.
3. **Emulsifier (5%):** Vegetable-based emulsifying wax (prevents separation).

### Process:
1. Heat the water phase and the oil phase in separate containers to 70°C.
2. Slowly pour the water phase into the oil phase while the **Magnetic Stirrer** is running at high speed.
3. Continue stirring until the mixture cools and turns into a thick, white cream.

## Ⅴ. SAFETY & QUALITY CONTROL
- **pH Verification:** Always ensure soap is between pH 8-10. Moisturizers should be acidic (pH 5.5) to match the skin's barrier.
- **Sterility:** Since moisturizers contain water, they are prone to mold. Use your **Glovebox (SAB)** when bottling to ensure a sterile environment.
- **Natural Preservation:** Add Vitamin E (Tocopherol) to prevent oils from going rancid.
