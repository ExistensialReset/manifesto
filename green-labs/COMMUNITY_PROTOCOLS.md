# Sharing Knowledge in Crisis Without Creating Danger

## 1. Verify Identity First
- Only teach people you know personally
- Face-to-face training only (no digital trail)
- No names in documentation

## 2. Teach Safety Before Technique
- Week 1: Lab safety, sterile technique
- Week 2: Diagnostic testing (reagents)
- Week 3: Simple extractions (penicillin)
- Week 4: Advanced synthesis (only if Week 1-3 passed)

## 3. Establish Mutual Aid Network
- Different people specialize in different medicines
- Share equipment (scale, glovebox, stirrer)
- Buddy system: Never work alone
- Emergency communication (non-digital if possible)

## 4. Document Without Incriminating
- Use code words for compounds
- Keep no written records with names
- Memorize critical steps
- Destroy notes after transfer to trusted person
