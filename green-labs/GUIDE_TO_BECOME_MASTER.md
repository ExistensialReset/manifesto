## Ⅰ. Introduction

Welcome to the Master Index Guide for navigating the /green-labs and /do-it-yourself archives. This document is designed to provide **context, purpose, and ethical framing** for each area, helping users understand the intent and boundaries of the materials.

> Knowledge is not dangerous; misuse is. Understanding context is the first step to mastery.

## Ⅱ. /green-labs — Medicinal Sovereignty

**Purpose:** Document and preserve access to essential medicines in contexts where commercial availability is limited or cost-prohibitive.

### Key Points:

- **Focus:** Pharmaceuticals and life-essential compounds.  
- **Goal:** Education, documentation, and advocacy for baseline access.  
- **Ethical Stance:** Knowledge exists because systemic failures prevent guaranteed access to medicine. Not an endorsement to produce without proper supervision.  
- **Core Resources:** Penicillin, anxiolytics, insulin, opioid antidotes, and emergency medicine protocols.  
- **Safety & Legality:** Strict adherence to protective measures and local laws is required. Content is for informational purposes only.

**See:** [README.md](README.md), [INDEX_READ_FIRST.md](INDEX_READ_FIRST.md), [APPENDIX_GREEN_LABS.md](APPENDIX_GREEN_LABS.md)

## Ⅲ. /do-it-yourself — Maker & Self-Sufficiency

**Purpose:** Explore small-scale, practical, and creative self-sufficiency projects.

### Key Points:

- **Focus:** DIY biology, home cultivation, small-scale lab tools, and sustainability experiments.  
- **Examples:**  
  - Growing sprouts, microgreens, and mushrooms indoors.  
  - Closet aquaponics systems.  
  - Homemade magnetic stirrers and other laboratory tools.  
- **Goal:** Encourage creativity, self-reliance, and educational experimentation.  
- **Ethical Stance:** Intended for learning, simulation, and safe experimentation within legal limits.

> This area is **practical experimentation**, not medicinal or life-critical intervention.

- **S (Spontaneity / Creativity):** Empowering self-directed problem solving.  
- **I (Integration / Empathy):** Supporting community resilience and reducing dependence on centralized scarcity.
