## Ⅰ. Welcome, Apprentice

This guide exists to orient **anyone entering /green-labs**—not to teach shortcuts, but to **understand the archive, its purpose, and its ethical grounding**.

> *“To become Master is first to understand the responsibility of knowledge, the weight of scarcity, and the principles of Flow.”*

**Your compass here is threefold:**

1. **Calm (L):** Steady your mind and hands. Knowledge without control is dangerous.  
2. **Spontaneity (S):** Curiosity fuels insight, but must be guided by ethics.  
3. **Integration (I):** All actions affect others. Respect life and systems.

## Ⅱ. Structure of the Archive

The archive is organized to reflect **both survival knowledge and systemic critique**:

| File / Folder | Purpose | Notes |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| **README.md** | Master list of recipes & protocols | Practical overview; shows what exists |
| **INDEX_READ_FIRST.md** | Context, risk, and systemic justification | “Why this exists” / high-level warnings |
| **APPENDIX_GREEN_LABS.md** | Principles, ethics, and M-OS-R integration | Deep rationale; links practices to Flow philosophy |
| **Individual .md recipes** | Detailed procedural guides | **Educational only**; safety and legality emphasized |
| **/do-it-yourself** | Optional experimental / simulation content | For conceptual testing, not physical implementation |

> **Note:** Reading order is important: start with INDEX_READ_FIRST.md → README.md → APPENDIX_GREEN_LABS.md → then dive into specific recipes if necessary.

## Ⅲ. Core Principles for Masters

1. **Ethical Sovereignty:** Knowledge is a tool for life protection, not profit.  
2. **Context Awareness:** Recipes exist because the system fails some humans. Recognize **why they exist** before thinking “how”.  
3. **Safety First:** Always prioritize personal protection, environment, and legal compliance.  
4. **Documentation:** Keep clear, private notes if experimenting—learning without leaving risks behind.  
5. **Flow Integration:** Each action should strengthen community resilience and reduce dependency on centralized scarcity systems.

> *“A true Master does not simply know the recipe; they understand the system and their role within it.”*

## Ⅳ. Navigating Knowledge Safely

- **Simulate first:** Map processes conceptually before physical exploration.  
- **Use protective gear:** Gloveboxes, scales, ventilation, eye protection.  
- **Respect boundaries:** Not all materials are safe for home use.  
- **Collaborate ethically:** Share knowledge responsibly, never endanger others.

## Ⅴ. Relation to M-OS-R / Flow

/green-labs is more than a library; it is a **living testament to systemic pressure**:

- **Baseline Security (L):** Documents access gaps in essential medicines.  
- **Spontaneity & Empowerment (S):** Preserves techniques for knowledge, not coercion.  
- **Integration & Care (I):** Encourages ethical reflection and collective wellbeing.

> In Flow, this archive becomes obsolete—but until then, it **preserves life-critical knowledge and ethical insight**.

---

## Ⅵ. Warning & Responsibility

- **This is not a guide to action:** Materials are for **learning, awareness, and emergency preparedness**.  
- **You are responsible:** If you step beyond conceptual understanding, **all risk is yours**.  
- **Systemic critique matters:** The real problem is scarcity, patenting, and denial of care—not the knowledge itself.

## Ⅶ. Path of the Master

1. Understand the archive’s **structure and purpose**.  
2. Internalize the **ethical and Flow principles**.  
3. Engage with recipes **conceptually first**.  
4. Reflect on **why these resources exist**.  
5. Document insights **securely**.  
6. Share knowledge **responsibly**.

> *Mastery is **not about doing everything**, but knowing the weight and context of each action.*
