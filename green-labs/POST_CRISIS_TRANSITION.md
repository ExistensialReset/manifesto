# Transitioning Back to Commercial Medicine Safely

## When Pharmacies Reopen:

1. **Don't Stop DIY Medicine Immediately**
   - Gradually transition over 1-2 weeks
   - Verify commercial medicine is consistent
   - Keep DIY as backup for 6 months

2. **Medical Reconciliation**
   - Tell doctor honestly what you took
   - Bring samples if possible for testing
   - Check for interactions with new prescriptions

3. **Equipment Disposal**
   - Clean all glassware thoroughly
   - Store safely (may need again)
   - Do NOT throw chemicals in trash
   - Neutralize acids/bases before disposal

4. **Community Debrief**
   - What worked? What didn't?
   - Update documentation with lessons
   - Prepare for next crisis (they come in cycles)
