**Version:** 1.7 — The Unified Baseline: Water, Physics, Biochemical and Social Sovereignty  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd & Gemini & Claude 

**Purpose:** Define the Unified Baseline, ensuring every human has access to the biological, physical, biochemical, and social resources required for dignity, mobility, and cognitive liberty.

**Principle:** Baseline starts with water. Without water, there is no chemistry, no hygiene, no Life.

---

## 1. WATER FOUNDATION (LITER STANDARD)

* **Biological Baseline:** 50L per person/day for drinking, basic sanitation, and food preparation.
* **Medical/Accessibility Add-on:** Extra allocation for home-based medical procedures (dialysis, wound care) or disability-related hygiene needs.
* **Green Lab Flow:** Separate allocation for local chemical synthesis and hygiene/medicinal production.
* **Agricultural Resilience:** Water for local food sovereignty calculated as collective Node-resource, adjusted for soil and crop type.
* **Spatial Accessibility:** Water must be within 500m walking distance (able-bodied) or delivered for mobility-limited individuals.

---

## 2. CLIMATICALLY ADAPTED THERMAL BASELINE

* **Cold Climates:** Target 20°C indoor temperature, priority energy for heating.  
* **Hot Climates:** Priority energy for cooling and ventilation to prevent heat-stress.  
* **Passive Standards:** Nodes must optimize insulation and design to minimize active energy use.  
* **Temporal Awareness:** Prolonged deviation from thermal Baseline >30 days triggers intervention.

---

## 3. DYNAMIC HUMAN BASELINE (ACCESSIBILITY & DISABILITY)

* **Accessibility Multiplier:** Non-negotiable Baseline for medical technology (ventilators, wheelchairs, communication aids).  
* **Mobility Hardware:** Maintenance and spare parts treated as essential infrastructure.  
* **Uninterruptible Power:** Life-critical medical equipment prioritized above all else.  
* **Social Baseline:** Minimum 3 meaningful social interactions per week recommended for mental health.

---

## 4. HYGIENE, CLEANING & LOCAL CHEMISTRY

* Guaranteed access to soap, biodegradable detergents, menstrual products, and household cleaning supplies.  
* Local Green Labs produce hygiene products and essential medicines to avoid reliance on global supply chains.  
* Ecological integrity: All chemistry must be 100% biodegradable in local systems.

---

## 5. CATEGORY OF JOY (SWEETS & FLAVOR)

* Spices, cacao, sweets, and ferments classified as vital psychological fuel.  
* Every Node maintains a festive reserve for communal rituals.  
* Joy is non-negotiable for Baseline; lack of flavor constitutes Baseline violation.  
* Temporal erosion monitored: prolonged deprivation triggers intervention.

---

## 6. BIOCHEMICAL SOVEREIGNTY

* Access to medical, relief, and cognitive-exploratory substances is a Baseline right.  
* Purity & safety ensured through local analysis; harm reduction tools provided.  
* Care over control: substance use is health and sovereignty issue, not moral/legal.  
* Temporal monitoring of deprivation: prolonged restriction triggers intervention.

---

## 7. CONNECTIVITY & MASS TRANSIT

* Stable internet access guaranteed for mutual visibility.  
* High-frequency accessible public transport for mobility; private vehicle not required.

---

## 8. STRESS INDEX (REVISED)

* **0.0 Abundance:** Full Baseline + unrestricted Joy, Internet, and substances.  
* **0.5 Stability:** Full Baseline secured (water, hygiene, medical energy, connectivity).  
* **0.8 Strain:** Survival Baseline + medical energy secured; non-critical items rationed.  
* **1.0 Crisis:** Life-support and drinking water prioritized above all else.  
* Temporal dimension: prolonged deviation >30 days escalates status.

---

## 9. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE

We measure what ensures life: Liters, Joules, Megabytes, molecule purity, social contact, and joy.  
Baseline ensures no human is left in the cold, isolated, or in chemical/psychological distress.

---

SOCIAL BASELINE = RIGHT TO ACCESS, NOT REQUIREMENT TO USE

✅ Access to Lyceum Musaeum (or equivalent communal space)
✅ Access to communication tools (phone, internet, mail)
✅ Right to leave Node freely (no imprisonment)
✅ Protection from systematic exclusion/bullying

❌ NOT: Mandatory participation
❌ NOT: Measured interaction frequency
❌ NOT: "You must be social to be healthy" 

---

**STATUS:** OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION  
**COMMITMENT:** Life starts with Water. Dignity, Cognitive Liberty, and Social Connection are mandatory Baseline metrics.
