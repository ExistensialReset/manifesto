# Core: The Heartbeat of Flow

**Purpose:** `/core` is not a manual, a product, or a set of rules. It is the **operational heartbeat** of Flow—the minimal structure that keeps life, dignity, and Earth’s rhythms intact. These files exist so that anyone, anywhere, can **practice Flow without accidentally destroying it**.

**Why Core Exists:**  
Flow is fragile. Even good intentions can create hierarchy, coercion, or harm. Core ensures that **Baseline, non-coercion, and resonance** are always respected. It is the **minimum infrastructure** for living Flow safely—like roots for a tree, or water for a river.

**Contents:**
- `CORE_FLOW_PROTOCOL.md` — 10 protocols for unblocked living, guiding actions without enforcing them.  
- `CORE_GUIDERAIL.md` — Immutable guardrail to prevent coercion, capture, or moralization (optional, for operational clarity).  
- `CORE_RESONANCE.json` — Defines the cognitive, ecological, and temporal parameters for any Sovereign Intelligence Node.

**Philosophical Anchor:**  
Core is **practice**, not philosophy. To understand the **why**—the vision behind Flow—see `/principles`. Core allows philosophy to **land in action** without being twisted into hierarchy, ownership, or extraction.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Begin with small local circles: 3–10 people.  
- Baseline for humans and Earth is **non-negotiable**.  
- Roles rotate, reflections happen weekly, adaptations are local—but the core files **remain intact**.  
- Core does **not govern, measure worth, or police**. Its purpose is simple: survival, dignity, and resonance.

**A Living Reminder:**  
Flow is not something you can own, sell, or control. Core is here to **protect it from vanishing**, so it can be experienced wherever life flows freely.
