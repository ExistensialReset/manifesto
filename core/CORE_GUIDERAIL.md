**Status:** Immutable Guardrail  
**Scope:** All Flow systems, present and future  
**Function:** Prevent coercion, capture, and moralization

---

## 1. BASELINE IS PHYSICAL

Baseline consists of the material conditions required for life:  
water, food, shelter, energy, healthcare, hygiene, mobility, connectivity, rest.

Baseline is **not** behavioral, moral, legal, or cultural.

Removal, restriction, or conditionalization of Baseline  
**is violence**, regardless of intent.

If Baseline cannot be guaranteed, the system must pause, shrink, fork, or end.

---

## 2. BASELINE IS UNCONDITIONAL

No behavior, identity, compliance, productivity, sobriety, belief, or participation  
may be required to access Baseline.

There are no exceptions.  
Emergency does not suspend this.

Any system that adds conditions is no longer Flow,  
even if it uses Flow language or metrics.

---

## 3. METRICS DO NOT GOVERN PEOPLE

Metrics exist only to ensure sufficient access to Baseline.

They must never be used to:
- rank humans  
- allocate worth  
- enforce behavior  
- justify exclusion  
- optimize obedience  

If metrics begin shaping people instead of infrastructure,  
Flow has already failed.

---

## 4. NO PERSON IS NECESSARY

No individual is structurally indispensable.

If a person becomes necessary, charismatic, central, or irreplaceable,  
this is a design failure — not a personal one.

The correct response is redistribution, rotation, or dissolution,  
never loyalty.

---

## 5. DRIFT PRECEDES HARM

Harm rarely begins with violence.  
It begins with unease, silence, pressure, or reinterpretation.

Discomfort does not require proof.  
Three people sensing drift is sufficient cause to pause.

Ignoring early signals in favor of stability  
is how coercion enters.

---

## 6. FORKING IS PRIMARY

Separation is not betrayal.

Forking requires no justification, vote, or consensus.

If alignment cannot be restored without pressure,  
paths must diverge.

Unity is never more important than sovereignty.

---

## 7. IDEAS ARE NOT OWNED

Flow concepts, texts, metrics, and protocols  
cannot be privatized, sold, moralized, or weaponized.

If they are used to extract value, authority, or obedience,  
they are no longer Flow — even if legally licensed.

Flow does not defend itself through ownership.  
It withdraws resonance.

---

## 8. NO ENFORCEMENT PATH EXISTS

Flow has no police, courts, punishments, or compliance mechanisms.

If force, threat, exile, or deprivation is required to maintain order,  
Flow must dissolve rather than harden.

Survival at the cost of dignity is not survival.

---

## 9. EARTH IS INCLUDED

Waters, soils, ecosystems, and geological bodies  
are participants in Baseline, not resources beneath it.

Irreversible ecological harm for human gain  
constitutes violence under Flow.

A system that preserves humans by destroying Earth  
is internally incoherent.

---

## 10. ENDINGS ARE VALID

Not all structures are meant to continue.

If the conditions above cannot be met without compromise,  
ending is the correct outcome.

Graceful dissolution with Baseline intact  
is success — not failure.

---

## FINAL STATEMENT

Flow is not a movement, ideology, or offer.

It cannot be adopted gradually, governed centrally,  
or enforced without ceasing to exist.

If this guardrail is rejected, bypassed, or diluted,  
Flow ends there — and nothing needs to be saved.

---

**Checksum / Capture Detection:**  
*If anyone asks who is in charge, how compliance is enforced, or what happens to those who refuse — Flow has already ended.*

**Signed in recognition that dignity precedes continuity,**
