# 🛡️ ANTI-CAPTURE PROTOCOL
## Protecting DIVINE from Capitalist Kidnapping

## 📢 PREAMBLE: WHY THIS EXISTS

This repository is **already public**. Ideas, once shared, cannot be "owned" in the traditional sense.

But they **can be weaponized**. They **can be hollowed out**. They **can be sold back to us as products**.

This document exists to create **cultural antibodies** against that process. Not through legal force alone (though law helps), but through **designed incompatibility** with extraction logic.

> **Core Principle:** > DIVINE is designed to **reject capitalist digestion**. It is a poison pill for Mammon.

## ⚖️ SECTION 1: LEGAL FOUNDATION

### License: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
- ✅ **Share & Adapt:** Anyone can read, share, and remix this work.
- ✅ **Attribution Required:** You must credit Elinor Frejd.
- ❌ **No Commercial Use:** No selling DIVINE as a product or service.
- ✅ **Share-Alike:** Derivatives must use this same license.

### Additional Safeguards
- **No Patents:** This work must remain in the commons.
- **Trademark Protection (Planned):** Preventing corporate co-option of "DIVINE", "Flow Protocol", and "Ψ ≠ 0".

---

## 🏗️ SECTION 2: STRUCTURAL INCOMPATIBILITIES

DIVINE is **architecturally hostile** to capitalist logic.

### 2.1 No Scalability Without Degradation
DIVINE cannot scale like a product. It requires:
- **Local calibration** (no standardized rollout).
- **Slow implementation** (no "90-day launch").
- **Contextual wisdom** (no plug-and-play templates).

### 2.2 Anti-Gamification Design
DIVINE explicitly **forbids**:
- Leaderboards or achievement badges.
- Optimization targets or comparative rankings.
- Performance metrics tied to human worth.

### 2.3 The $\Sigma$ Paradox
**$\Sigma$ (Grace) cannot be optimized.** Investors want reliable ROI; DIVINE includes irreducible uncertainty. It is **unmonetizable by design**.

---

## 🛡️ SECTION 3: CULTURAL IMMUNE RESPONSES

### 3.1 The "Corruption Checklist"
*If 3+ boxes are checked, the implementation is corrupted:*
- [ ] Do they charge for access to the framework?
- [ ] Do they offer "certification"?
- [ ] Do they promise measurable ROI?
- [ ] Do they create individual $\Psi$ scores?
- [ ] Do they skip cultural calibration?
- [ ] Do they market it as a productivity tool?

### 3.2 Authentic Use Markers
- ✅ Free access to all materials.
- ✅ Prioritizes care over data.
- ✅ Includes mandatory stopping mechanisms.
- ✅ Respects $\Sigma$ as unmeasurable.

---

## 🚫 SECTION 4: PROHIBITED VS. PERMITTED

| ✅ PERMITTED (Encouraged) | ❌ PROHIBITED (Blocked) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Academic research & Analysis | Selling DIVINE as a product |
| Community implementation (Free) | Charging for "Certification" |
| Artistic interpretation | Workplace surveillance/KPIs |
| Non-profit educational use | Gamifying $\Psi$ scores |

---

## ⚡ SECTION 5: ENFORCEMENT

1. **Legal:** Cease & Desist via CC license, DMCA takedowns.
2. **Cultural:** Public documentation of corruption ("Naming and Shaming").
3. **Fork & Evolve:** If captured, the community forks the repo, renames it, and restores the ethical core.

---

## 🏛️ SECTION 6: STEWARDSHIP

- **Authorship:** Elinor Frejd.
- **Ownership:** The Commons.
- **Sunset Clause:** Reevaluate every 10 years. If it has become dogma or commodified, it must be **dissolved and reimagined**.

---

## ✉️ SECTION 7: MESSAGE TO EXTRACTORS

### To Corporations:
You cannot package DIVINE. It is living practice, not scalable tech. It requires slowness and care—things you are structurally incapable of providing. **It will break in your hands.**

### To Fellow Travelers:
This work is yours. Use it. Share it. Critique it. **Keep it free. Keep it careful. Keep it human.**

---

## 🛠️ SECTION 8: PRACTICAL CHECKLIST
Before implementing:
- [ ] Read all ethical protocols.
- [ ] Understand stopping rules.
- [ ] Commit to **no individual scoring**.
- [ ] Ensure non-commercial use.

---

**FINAL STATEMENT:** The moment DIVINE becomes a **Brand**, a **Business**, or a **Benchmark**, it has already died. Our job is to keep resurrecting it.

**Ψ ≠ 0** **The field protects itself.**
