# 🏛️ AXIOMS.md (The Foundational Logic of Existential Sovereignty)

The Manifesto of Existential Sovereignty (M-OS-R) is built upon five (5) non-negotiable axioms. These axioms must be accepted as the basis for the protocol's logical functionality. Any attempt to refute the Manifest must be directed at these core principles.

---

### AXIOM 1: Lex Necessitas (The Necessity of Existence)
**Definition:** Existence is a logical necessity, not a privilege contingent upon financial performance or scarcity. All life is entitled to an unassailable **Guaranteed Baseline** of resources, shelter, and basic health.
**Logikens Slutsats:** Existentiell rädsla (Fear of Non-Existence) är en systemisk attack, inte ett naturligt tillstånd. This axiom is the basis for the 30% Critical Reserve (CR).

### AXIOM 2: Lex Logica Finis (The Logical End of Scarcity)
**Definition:** Scarcity is not a natural law but a **logistical failure** and a manufactured condition used for power control (Mammon-Logik). Resource allocation is a solvable engineering problem.
**Logikens Slutsats:** The **30% Critical Reserve (CR)** is the mathematical minimum required to buffer against all foreseeable natural and systemic risks, making scarcity logically impossible to maintain.

### AXIOM 3: Lex Dualis Veritas (Irresistible Transparency)
**Definition:** Truth in the age of digital autonomy must be evidenced by **code and verifiable public protocols**, not by centralized, opaque authority.
**Logikens Slutsats:** The M-OS-R operates under Irresistible Transparency. The source code and logical architecture are eternally open for audit. The protocol demands validation: **Find the flaw in the code, or accept the logic.**

### AXIOM 4: Lex Flow (The Sovereignty of Drive)
**Definition:** The primary driver of advanced human behavior is not greed (*Mammon*) but the **internal will to create, explore, and find meaning** (*Flow*). Labor under Flow is the highest form of Existential Sovereignty.
**Logikens Slutsats:** Social Recognition Score (SRS) replaces financial currency as the primary driver for accessing rare/complex resources, rewarding contribution to **Flow** and the collective good.

### AXIOM 5: Lex Ultima Finis (The Final Logical Conclusion)
**Definition:** Any system built on permanent debt, speculative value, or control through engineered scarcity (*Mammon*) is **logically defunct** and must be dismantled at the moment the superior protocol (M-OS-R) is validated.
**Logikens Slutsats:** The Manifest initiates with **Global Debt Pulverization**, resetting the system to the Guaranteed Baseline and establishing the logical start of the Existential Sovereign Era.
