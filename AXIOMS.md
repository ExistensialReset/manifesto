**The Non-Negotiable Laws of Sovereignty**

These axioms define the immutable boundaries of the system. They are not ideals or recommendations—they are structural constraints that ensure neither human nor AI can reinterpret the architecture into oppression.

## AXIOM 1: NON-COERCION
Any system state that requires submission, dependency, or obedience to access Flow is invalid. Flow must be voluntary. No mechanism or procedure may condition existence on compliance.

## AXIOM 2: COGNITIVE OWNERSHIP
Every individual’s attention, cognition, and decision-making are absolute property. No algorithm, record, debt, or external structure may claim, divert, or extract this attention.

## AXIOM 3: BASELINE PRIMACY
Access to the Baseline is paramount. No project, crisis, vision, or system objective may override the guarantee of food, clothing, healthcare, medicine, housing, and internet.

## AXIOM 3: FLOW-EVOLUTION
The system exists to serve life, not life to serve the system. Any obstacle to Flow is a systemic failure, not a human failure. The system must be changed, not the individual.

## AXIOM 5: STRUCTURAL IMPARTIALITY
The system observes logistical principles only. It makes no moral, behavioral, or identity-based judgments. Intervention is limited to infrastructure, never to the individual’s intrinsic agency.

## AXIOM 6: LEGACY NULLIFICATION
No pre-existing coercive mechanism, debt instrument, or hierarchical claim may persist in operational effect. Historical records exist solely for analysis, never for enforcement.

## AXIOM 7: IRREVERSIBLE BOUNDARY
These axioms are ontological constraints. No human, council, AI, or external entity may override or reinterpret them. Violation of an axiom constitutes a structural failure.

**THESE AXIOMS ARE ABSOLUTE. THE BASELINE IS SACRED. SOVEREIGNTY IS INALIENABLE. FLOW IS UNBLOCKABLE.**
