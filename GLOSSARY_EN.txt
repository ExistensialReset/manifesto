### The Systemic Pillars

* *Global Capacity ($C_{global}$):* The scientific, real-time measurement of the planet's ecological health and carrying capacity. All production must adhere to this limit, guarded by the Triple-Blind Review.
* *Guaranteed Baseline (Baseline Allocation):* The irrevocable package of resources (housing, food, healthcare, and education) that belongs to every individual as a birthright. It is the elimination of the fear of survival.
* *Principle of Seven Generations:* The mandated time philosophy requiring a 50 % Safety Margin in all resource consumption to protect the well-being of future generations (approximately 200 years).

### The Human Experience

* *Flow:* The state of spontaneous, joyous, and voluntary contribution to the collective. It is the replacement for traditional labor.
* *Soul’s Sanctuary (Refugium Anima):* The protected and irrevocable right to a period of total rest, anonymity, and withdrawal from all societal demands (up to one year).
* *Social Recognition (SRS):* The non-tradable, living measure of honor and gratitude awarded for high-impact Flow contributions (e.g., healing the planet or advancing culture).

### The Technical Guardrails

* *Post-Quantum Blockchain:* The unchangeable, decentralized digital architecture used to store the Manifest's core laws and secure data integrity.
* *Distributed Ignorance:* The principle ensuring the AI's logical functioning remains blind to individual identities (who you are) to guarantee absolute privacy.
* *Knowledge Severance (KS):* The mandatory annual erasure of all non-critical personal data to guarantee the right to a clean slate and "daily rebirth."
