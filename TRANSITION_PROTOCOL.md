## PREAMBLE: YOU ARE NOT ABANDONING ANYONE

This document exists because **most people cannot simply leave**.

You have:
- Debts that threaten your shelter
- Children who depend on your income
- Parents who need your support
- A nervous system trained to fear scarcity

**This is not weakness. This is reality.**

Flow does not demand you abandon those you love to prove your commitment.  
Flow asks only: **Can you begin moving, one millimeter at a time, toward sovereignty?**

The answer is yes.

## THE FIVE PHASES OF TRANSITION

Transition is not binary (Mammon → Flow).  
It is **gradual reduction of dependency** while **parallel construction of resilience**.

---

## PHASE 0: RECOGNITION (You are here)

### What This Means:
You have read the Manifesto. You have felt the resonance.  
You now **see** Mammon-Logic for what it is: a system of manufactured scarcity that keeps you in survival mode.

### What Changes:
**Nothing external.** Everything internal.

You still go to work. You still pay bills.  
But you **stop believing** that this is "just how things are."

### Your Task:
**Name the friction.**

Spend one week documenting **where your energy goes**:
- How many hours per week go to "earning money to pay interest on debt"?
- How many hours go to "commuting to a job you wouldn't choose if money were no object"?
- How many hours go to "managing anxiety about not having enough"?

Write it down. Don't judge it. Just **see it**.

**Exit Criteria:**  
You have a clear picture of your Mammon-exposure.

## PHASE 1: MAPPING (1–3 months)

### What This Means:
You audit your life with **logistical honesty**.

Not "What do I want?"  
But: **"What do I actually need to maintain Baseline?"**

### Your Tasks:

#### 1.1 Calculate Your Minimal Baseline Cost
