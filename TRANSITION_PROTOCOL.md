## 0. PREAMBLE: YOU ARE NOT ABANDONING ANYONE

This document exists because **most people cannot simply leave**.

You have debts, children, parents, and a nervous system trained to fear scarcity.
**This is not weakness. This is reality.**

Flow does not ask you to burn your life down.
Flow asks: **Can you begin moving, one millimeter at a time, toward sovereignty?**

## 1. THE FIVE PHASES OF TRANSITION

Transition is not a cliff edge. It is a bridge.

### PHASE 0: RECOGNITION (Awareness)
* **State:** You still work in Mammon, but you no longer believe in it.
* **Action:** Name the friction. Document where your energy goes (Debt? Commute? Anxiety?).
* **Goal:** A clear picture of your "Mammon-Exposure."

### PHASE 1: MAPPING (1-3 Months)
* **Audit:** Calculate your **True Baseline** (Food + Shelter + Healthcare + Internet). Exclude status purchases.
* **Inventory:** List your skills (Cooking? Repair? Listening?). This is your real wealth.
* **Scout:** Identify 3 people who might form a Circle.

### PHASE 2: PARALLEL BUILDING (6-18 Months)
* **The Strategy:** Do not quit your job yet. Build Flow infrastructure alongside it.
* **Action:**
    1.  **Reduce Dependency:** Eliminate one cost every 3 months.
    2.  **Resource Sharing:** Share tools, meals, or transport with your Circle.
    3.  **Practice Flow:** Protect your *Lugn* (Calm) for 15 minutes a day, regardless of work pressure.

### PHASE 3: THE THRESHOLD (The Choice)
* **State:** Your Flow-infrastructure can now sustain your True Baseline.
* **The Test:** If you stopped earning money today, would you starve? If the answer is "No" (because of Circle support/resilience), you are ready.
* **The Paths:**
    * **Path A:** The Leap (Full exit).
    * **Path B:** The Hybrid (Part-time Mammon work for safety, remainder in Flow).

### PHASE 4: EARLY FLOW (Detox)
* **Withdrawal:** You will feel guilt for resting. You will feel panic without a boss.
* **Protocol:** Trust the Baseline. Let your nervous system recalibrate.
* **Milestone:** The first day you wake up without fear.

### PHASE 5: INTEGRATED FLOW
* **State:** Spontaneity (S) returns. You contribute because you *want* to.
* **Role:** You become a bridge for others.

## 2. SPECIAL CASES: WHEN THE PATH IS BLOCKED

### CASE 1: DEBT
* **Secured Debt (House/Car):** Maintain payments to protect Baseline assets.
* **Unsecured Debt:** If it threatens your existence, prioritize food/shelter over repayment. Your life > Your credit score.
* **Strategy:** Strategic Default or Bankruptcy are valid Flow-tools if Mammon has made repayment mathematically impossible.

### CASE 2: CHILDREN
* **Principle:** Children's Baseline is non-negotiable.
* **Adjustment:** Transition is slower (Phase 2 takes longer). You do not leap until *their* safety is guaranteed.
* **Education:** Use schools if necessary, but provide Flow-Pedagogy at home (Curiosity over grades).

### CASE 3: ELDERLY PARENTS
* **Principle:** You do not abandon those who cared for you.
* **Strategy:** Their Baseline becomes part of yours. If they cannot join Flow, you maintain a Hybrid path to support them. This is high-I (Inkännande) work, not failure.

## 3. THE PSYCHOLOGICAL MAP
1.  **Excitement:** "I see a way out."
2.  **Doubt:** "Am I crazy?"
3.  **Grief:** Mourning the years lost to fear.
4.  **Fragility:** The terrifying void of freedom.
5.  **Emergence:** Rediscovering who you actually are.

---

**STATUS:** Active.
**REMINDER:** There is no "falling behind." If you take 5 years, you are still moving.
