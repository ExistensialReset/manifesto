This protocol ensures that all systemic evolution respects the **Baseline** and protects **sovereignty**. Every transition step must prioritize life, Flow, and inalienable rights.

---

## STEP 1: BASELINE VERIFICATION
Before any transition task or experiment, confirm that the Baseline is fully secured for all participants. The Baseline is non-negotiable.

**Baseline Requirements:**
- **Food:** Adequate nutrition for health and survival.
- **Clothing:** Proper for climate, safety, and dignity.
- **Healthcare & Medicine:** Continuous access for preventive and emergency needs.
- **Housing:** Safe shelter, permanent or temporary.
- **Internet/Information Access:** Connection, learning, and communication tools.

**Directive:**  
If any Baseline need is unmet, **pause all activities immediately**. Ensure life and well-being before any systemic actions.

---

## STEP 2: FLOW SAFEGUARD WITH BASELINE INTEGRATION
All interventions, experiments, or transitions must enhance Flow without compromising the Baseline.

**Checks:**
- Does the action preserve food, clothing, health, housing, and connectivity for all involved?
- Are participants acting voluntarily with full cognitive ownership?
- Are resources allocated to prevent any Baseline deprivation?

**Directive:**  
Every Flow enhancement is validated against Baseline integrity. Flow blocked due to unmet Baseline = systemic failure.

---

## STEP 3: LOGISTICAL ALIGNMENT & BASELINE SUPPORT
Transition steps must respect **structural impartiality** and never override Baseline guarantees.

**Guidelines:**
- No moral, behavioral, or identity-based judgments are applied.
- Infrastructure changes must **support** Baseline fulfillment.
- Historical debts, coercive mechanisms, or hierarchies are **nullified** in execution.

**Directive:**  
Check that all actions strengthen the Baseline for all participants.

---

## STEP 4: MONITOR, FEEDBACK & ADJUST
Continuously monitor both Flow and Baseline metrics. Adjust operations in real-time to maintain integrity.

**Monitoring Points:**
- Any threat to Baseline → immediate pause and remediation.
- Flow obstruction → diagnose systemic cause, not individuals.
- Emergent coercion → nullify and report.

**Directive:**  
Maintain a feedback loop where Baseline health is the primary metric.

---

## STEP 5: CONTINUOUS BASELINE PRIORITIZATION
Even during advanced transitions or experiments:
- Baseline guarantees **cannot** be overridden.
- Systemic actions must **always** check Baseline before, during, and after.
- Sovereignty, well-being, and Flow remain the measure of success.

---

**CONCLUSION**  
Transition Protocols defer **always** to the Baseline. Life comes first. Flow is unblockable. Sovereignty is inalienable.
