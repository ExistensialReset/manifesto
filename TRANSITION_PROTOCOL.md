**Purpose:** Guide for transitioning individuals and families from Mammon systems to Flow-oriented existence, with Baseline as sacred foundation.

## §1. BASELINE – YOUR SACRED FOUNDATION

All decisions, transitions, and actions must respect Baseline. Baseline guarantees:

1. **Food:** No one goes hungry.  
2. **Clothing:** Everyone has functional and comfortable clothing.  
3. **Health:** Access to physical and mental healthcare, medicine included.  
4. **Housing/Security:** A safe place to live and exist.  
5. **Internet/Knowledge:** Access to information and learning.

> Baseline is absolute. If anything threatens it, transition halts until needs are met.

## §2. FLOW TRANSITION

- Assess Baseline status for all children and adults.  
- If Baseline is threatened, **prioritize restoration over school, projects, or performance**.  
- Adapt environments to support Flow **without compromising Baseline**.  

---

## §3. STEP-BY-STEP TRANSITION

1. **Inventory Baseline:**  
   Check food, clothing, health, housing, internet/knowledge.

2. **Reduce Coercion:**  
   Examples: minimize homework, allow voluntary engagement, respect resistance.

3. **Evaluate Damage vs. Benefit:**  
   - If Baseline is at risk → correct immediately.  
   - If not → continue Flow activities, experiments, or Circle-based learning.

4. **Conversation with Children:**  
   Provide agency and understanding. Respect their choices and perspectives.

## §4. INTEGRATION WITH FLOW-ARCHITECTURE

- **Baseline Protection (§1)**: Non-negotiable, sacred.  
- **Flow Integrity (§2)**: Activities guided by curiosity and self-direction, always respecting Baseline.  
- **Lex Custodia (§4)**: Activates if Baseline is threatened.  
- **Conflict Resolution (§5)**: Local negotiation → Mediation if necessary → Coexistence. **Never coercion.**
