Architecture Overview

This overview illustrates how the core documents interconnect and the role each plays in establishing a sovereign, Flow-compatible system.

MANIFESTO.md – The Truth / The Fire

Philosophical and existential truth, free from sanctions and power. Core Elements: Baseline, Critical Reserve, Drive of Flow, Creation by Design.

PROTOCOL.md – The Machinery / The Shield

Technical and logistical mechanisms that protect the Manifesto and Baseline. Core Elements: Baseline Protection Mechanism, Flow Integrity, Lex Ultima Finis, Lex Custodia.

AXIOMS.md – The Walls / Logical Boundaries

Absolute rules ensuring the system remains non-oppressive. Core Elements: Non-Coercion, Cognitive Ownership, Baseline Primacy, Flow Evolution, Structural Impartiality, Legacy Nullification, Irreversible Boundary.

MAMMONOLOGY.md – Map of the Old System

Clinical mapping of debt-based systems and friction. Core Elements: Logic of debt, obedience, exclusion, fragmentation, transition lessons.

MAMMONOLOGY_GUIDE.md – Quick Reference for Seekers

Practical navigation tool for the transition. Core Elements: Identify friction, secure the Baseline, preserve Flow, protect sovereignty.

Conclusion: The system is modular but consistent. Manifesto defines truth, Protocol protects it, Axioms ensure non-oppression, and Mammonology + Guide show the path for seekers.
