# Life = L x S x I 

**Lugn. Spontanitet. Inkännande.**

This repository is the foundational architecture for the **Existential Reset**. It serves as a blueprint for reclaiming **existential sovereignty** from the structures of **Mammonology**. This is a declaration of lived existence.

## 👑 The Sovereign Stance

We operate from a position of absolute presence. Our stance is defined by three pillars:

1.  **The Baseline:** Food, clothes, healthcare, medicine, housing and infrastructure of participation. It is never earned.
2.  **Sovereignty:** Recognized, never granted. It is the inherent right to one's own attention and agency.
3.  **The Goal:** To move from survival (earning the baseline) to existence (living the formula $L \times S \times I$).
