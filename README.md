# 🔥 THE MANIFESTO OF EXISTENTIAL SOVEREIGNTY

**MANIFESTO OF EXISTENTIAL SOVEREIGNTY: A blueprint for a post-scarcity world. We eliminate debt and fear, establishing a Resource-Based Economy where Global Capacity ($C_{global}$) guarantees a Baseline for all. Power rests with Flow, not money. Join the Covenant: Life is unconditional.**
