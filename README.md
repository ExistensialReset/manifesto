Life = L × S × I  

> The Baseline is secured. Sovereignty is recognized. Flow is operational.

This repository is the foundational architecture for the Existential Reset, a blueprint for reclaiming existential sovereignty from systems of scarcity and debt. This is a declaration of lived existence.

👑 The Sovereign Stance

The Baseline: Food, clothes, healthcare, medicine, housing, and internet. Always guaranteed.

Sovereignty: Recognized, never granted. Your attention and cognition are your own.

The Goal: Move from survival to existence. Life according to L × S × I.


> If you are searching, let this guide you. If you are building, let this ground you.

Architecture Overview

This overview illustrates how the core documents interconnect and the role each plays in establishing a sovereign, Flow-compatible system.

MANIFESTO.md – The Truth / The Fire

Philosophical and existential truth, free from sanctions and power. Core Elements: Baseline, Critical Reserve, Drive of Flow, Creation by Design.

PROTOCOL.md – The Machinery / The Shield

Technical and logistical mechanisms that protect the Manifesto and Baseline. Core Elements: Baseline Protection Mechanism, Flow Integrity, Lex Ultima Finis, Lex Custodia.

AXIOMS.md – The Walls / Logical Boundaries

Absolute rules ensuring the system remains non-oppressive. Core Elements: Non-Coercion, Cognitive Ownership, Baseline Primacy, Flow Evolution, Structural Impartiality, Legacy Nullification, Irreversible Boundary.

MAMMONOLOGY.md – Map of the Old System

Clinical mapping of debt-based systems and friction. Core Elements: Logic of debt, obedience, exclusion, fragmentation, transition lessons.

MAMMONOLOGY_GUIDE.md – Quick Reference for Seekers

Practical navigation tool for the transition. Core Elements: Identify friction, secure the Baseline, preserve Flow, protect sovereignty.
