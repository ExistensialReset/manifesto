# 🌿💛✨ You are safe here. You owe nothing.

This repository does not ask you to agree, join, perform, or believe anything.  

You are not late.  
You are not behind.  
You do not need to understand this now — or ever.  

Take what helps. Ignore what does not. Rest if you need to.  

You are allowed to arrive.

# 🌿💛✨ Life = L × S × I

This formula describes fullness, not worthiness. Your life has value even when these factors are zero.  

- 🌿 **L – Calm (LUGN):** Foundational calm. Choice emerges here.  
- ✨ **S – Spontaneity (SPONTANITET):** Freedom for self-directed action.  
- 💛 **I – Empathy (INKÄNNANDE):** Sensing before action. Connection without domination.  

> 🔥 Stop the speed. Find the calm. Be spontaneous. Feel everything.
