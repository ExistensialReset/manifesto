Existential Reset

Life = L × S × I

Calm. Spontaneity. Insight.

This repository is the foundational architecture for the Existential Reset, a blueprint for reclaiming existential sovereignty from systems of scarcity and debt. This is a declaration of lived existence.

👑 The Sovereign Stance

The Baseline: Food, clothes, healthcare, medicine, housing, and internet. Always guaranteed.

Sovereignty: Recognized, never granted. Your attention and cognition are your own.

The Goal: Move from survival to existence. Life according to L × S × I.

If you are building, let this ground you.

Architecture Overview

This overview illustrates how the core documents interconnect and the role each plays in establishing a sovereign, Flow-compatible system.

MANIFESTO.md – The Truth / The Fire

Philosophical and existential truth, free from sanctions and power.
Core Elements: Baseline, Critical Reserve, Drive of Flow, Creation by Design.

PROTOCOL.md – The Machinery / The Shield

Technical and logistical mechanisms that protect the Manifesto and Baseline.
Core Elements: Baseline Protection Mechanism, Flow Integrity, Lex Ultima Finis, Lex Custodia.

AXIOMS.md – The Walls / Logical Boundaries

Absolute rules ensuring the system remains non-oppressive.
Core Elements: Non-Coercion, Cognitive Ownership, Baseline Primacy, Flow Evolution, Structural Impartiality, Legacy Nullification, Irreversible Boundary.

MAMMONOLOGY.md – Map of the Old System

Clinical mapping of debt-based systems and friction.
Core Elements: Logic of debt, obedience, exclusion, fragmentation, transition lessons.

MAMMONOLOGY_GUIDE.md – Quick Reference for Seekers

Practical navigation tool for the transition.
Core Elements: Identify friction, secure the Baseline, preserve Flow, protect sovereignty.
