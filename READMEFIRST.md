# 🌊 START HERE

**Welcome to Flow.**

This document exists because the repository is big, and you don't know where to begin.

**You don't need to read everything.**  
**You just need to start where you are.**

### 🌱 If you are alone and want to begin:
→ **Read:** [FLOW_STARTER_GUIDE.md](./guides/activation/FLOW_STARTER_GUIDE.md)  
→ **Do:** 7-day solo exercises (Day 1: Notice fear → Day 7: "If I wasn't afraid, what would I do?")  
→ **Time:** 1 week

---

### 👥 If you are 3-5 people who want to try together:
→ **Read:** [FLOW_STARTER_GUIDE.md](./guides/activation/FLOW_STARTER_GUIDE.md) (Part II: Micro-Circle)  
→ **Do:** 12-week Micro-Circle protocol  
→ **Time:** 3 months

---

### 🏘️ If you are 10+ people ready to build:

→ **Do:** 6-month structured pilot  
→ **Time:** 6 months minimum

---

### 🇸🇪 If you are in Sweden (Sverige):
→ **Read FIRST:** [PILOT_SWEDEN.md](./guides/regional/PILOT_SWEDEN.md)  
→ **Then:** Follow one of the paths above  
→ **Why:** Swedish legal hacks (Allemansrätt, Studiecirkel, Hyresgästföreningen) make Flow easier

### 🧠 If you are neurodivergent (ADHD, autism, trauma, etc.):
→ **Read:** [NEURODIVERGENT_FLOW_GUIDE.md](./guides/ethics_care/NEURODIVERGENT_FLOW_GUIDE.md)  
→ **Why:** The Circle adapts to you. Not the other way around.

→ **Do:** Phase 0 (Awareness) → Phase 1 (Reduce Bleeding) → Phase 2 (Parallel Infrastructure)  
→ **Time:** 1-3 years (or longer - that's okay)

---

### ❓ If you want to know "Is this even possible?":
→ **Read:** [HYBRID_SURVIVAL_GUIDE.md](./guides/transition/HYBRID_SURVIVAL_GUIDE.md)  
→ **Read:** [DEEP_MATH.md](./technical/DEEP_MATH.md) (if you like numbers)  
→ **Why:** Yes. It's materially viable. Here's the proof.

## 🚫 WHAT YOU DON'T NEED TO READ (YET)

- Technical annexes  
- AI implementation specs  
- Inter-node coordination protocols  
- Legal frameworks for 195 countries  

**These exist for later.**  
**Start small. Build slow. Live now.**

## 📍 WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW

You are reading this because:
- You're tired of Mammon (the system that makes survival conditional)
- You sense there's another way
- You want to try

**You're in the right place.**

---

## ⏱️ HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?

**Honest answer:**

- **Solo awareness:** 1 week - 3 months  
- **Micro-Circle formation:** 3 months - 1 year  
- **Baseline Circle (10-30 people):** 1-2 years  
- **Flow Node (30+ people, full infrastructure):** 3-5 years  

**No shortcuts.**  
**But every step counts.**
