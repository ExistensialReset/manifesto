# THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE: Living in Flow

**What happens when the fear of “not having enough” is gone?**

This text describes everyday life when survival is no longer the organizing principle.

Not utopia.
Not perfection.
Just humans, finally out of constant threat.

## §1. The End of Survival Mode

For a long time, human life has been shaped by chronic existential stress.
Not always visible.
Often normalized.
Deeply internalized.

When the **Baseline** is secured, something fundamental changes.

- You wake up without the weight of debt.
- You eat because the earth provides, and logistics deliver.
- You rest without negotiating your worth.
- You create because curiosity is no longer punished.

The nervous system begins to downshift.
Life becomes inhabitable again.

## §2. Life = L × S × I

This is not a life of passivity.
It is a life of **meaning**
