# REFUGIUM_ANIMA_v2: Sanctuary & Recovery System
**Status:** CORE PROTOCOL  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Purpose:** Restoring the Baseline & Soul Recovery

---

## 🌿 PURPOSE
The Refugium Anima provides a structured space and practice for participants to restore their **Baseline**, recover vital energy, and maintain mental, emotional, and physical health. It is the "battery recharge" station for the Flow system, ensuring that the **L** (Calm) in our formula is never depleted.

---

## 💎 CORE PRINCIPLES
1. **Universal Accessibility:** Every participant has an inherent right to use the Refugium whenever the need arises.
2. **Guaranteed Safety:** The space is a sanctuary where both physical and emotional safety are absolute.
3. **Radical Non-judgment:** Usage of the Refugium is never questioned, ranked, or used as a metric for "weakness."
4. **Seamless Integration:** Usage is coordinated with Circle schedules to ensure the collective functions while the individual heals.
5. **Absolute Autonomy:** Participants are the sole architects of their recovery activities within the space.

## 🏛️ COMPONENTS
The Refugium is divided into specialized zones to cater to different recovery needs:

* **Quiet Zones:** Dedicated to silence, reflection, meditation, or deep sleep.
* **Active Zones (v2):** Spaces for light movement (yoga, stretching), creative expression, or therapy-based somatic activities.
* **Support Access:** Optional gateways to peer-led or professional support (mental health, logistical, or emotional).
* **Vital Resources:** Immediate access to high-quality nutrition, hydration, and essential self-care items.

---

## 📝 GUIDELINES FOR USE
* **Communication:** If extended usage is required, a brief check-in with the Circle facilitator is encouraged to manage group logistics.
* **Self-Reflection:** Daily short check-ins are suggested to monitor one’s own internal "Flow-meter."
* **Atmosphere:** Noise and disruptions must be kept to an absolute minimum in designated Quiet Zones.
* **Shared Wisdom:** Participants may voluntarily document insights in a shared "Sanctuary Journal" to help others, though this is never mandatory.

---

## 🛡️ SAFETY & SAFEGUARDS
* **Zero Coercion:** There is no monitoring or tracking of how much time is spent in recovery.
* **Emergency Link:** Emergency protocols are natively integrated (see `EMERGENCY_SAFEGUARDING.md`).
* **Boundaries:** Respect for personal space and "The Invisible Wall" is mandatory within the Refugium.

---

## 🔄 VERSION NOTES (v2)
* Added **Structured Active Zones** to recognize that recovery is sometimes movement-based, not just stillness-based.
* Integrated **Professional Support Access** for cases where peer-support is insufficient for Baseline restoration.
* Strengthened the balance between **Individual Recovery** and **Collective Responsibility**.
