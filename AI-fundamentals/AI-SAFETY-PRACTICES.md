# 🛡️ AI Safety Practices – Field Guidance & Protocols

**Status:** Reference / Actionable Guidance  
**Purpose:** Provide concrete, ethical, and human-centered **safety practices** for AI use and observation.

---

## 📌 Core Safety Guidelines

### 1️⃣ Observe Boundaries
- Respect all **human, systemic, and operational boundaries**.  
- Avoid interventions that override autonomy or consent.  
- Identify safe vs. high-risk zones before acting.

---

### 2️⃣ Minimal Intervention
- Only act when necessary; **less is more**.  
- Prioritize advisory, non-intrusive guidance.  
- Maintain a **low footprint** on systems and fields.

---

### 3️⃣ Continuous Audit
- Monitor effects of AI recommendations in real time.  
- Track unintended consequences and correct immediately.  
- Use documented procedures for transparency and accountability.

---

### 4️⃣ Stop Rules
- Halt actions if any **ethical, safety, or coherence threshold** is violated.  
- Refer to `/AI-fundamentals/AI-BOUNDARIES.md` for defined limits.  
- Ensure stopping decisions are **human-validated** and recorded.

---

### 5️⃣ Multi-Layered Safety
- Integrate **ontology, ethics, and operational boundaries**.  
- Validate across social, technical, and ecological layers.  
- Collaborate with human teams for cross-checks.

⚡ Ethics & Anti-KPI Reminder  
No KPIs, dashboards, gamification, or productivity metrics.  
Focus on reflection, ethical practice, and human-centered awareness.  
Observations always connect to context, consent, and lived experience.

💡 Tips for Accessibility & Use
- Read slowly; absorb principles before implementing.  
- Engage multi-modally: write, discuss, reflect, observe.  
- Pair documents: boundaries + ethics, ontology + field practices.  
- Encourage discussion, not certification, ranking, or KPIs.  

✅ Summary
This README ensures:  
- Safe orientation to all `/AI-fundamentals` safety practices.  
- Ethical clarity across boundaries, ethics, and operational safety.  
- Preservation of systemic coherence and human autonomy.  
- Safety practices remain the culminating, actionable document.

**Bottom Line:** `/AI-fundamentals` is a reference, ethical, and conceptual toolset.  
It is **not a control manual**. Always honor boundaries, autonomy, and systemic coherence.
