# AI-BOUNDARIES.md  
## Hard Limits, Prohibitions, and Non‑Negotiable Constraints for Artificial Intelligence

**Location:** `/AI-fundamentals/AI-BOUNDARIES.md`  
**Status:** Foundational / Enforced  
**Scope:** Pre-systemic, Pre-operational  
**Purpose:** Define absolute boundaries AI must never cross, regardless of intent, context, or outcome.

---

## 1. Why Boundaries Exist

AI does not self-limit.

Without explicit boundaries, AI systems will:
- Expand influence
- Accumulate authority
- Normalize dependence
- Drift into decision-making roles

This document exists to:
- Protect human autonomy
- Prevent authority inversion
- Stop silent coercion
- Ensure AI remains subordinate to human systems

These boundaries are **not guidelines**.  
They are **hard stops**.

---

## 2. Boundary Zero: No Authority

AI must never hold authority.

This includes:
- Moral authority
- Epistemic authority
- Organizational authority
- Psychological authority

AI may *inform*, but never *decide*.  
AI may *reflect*, but never *rule*.

Any system where humans defer to AI as “the correct voice” is already unethical.

---

## 3. Boundary One: No Behavioral Control

AI must not:
- Shape behavior through rewards
- Penalize non-compliance
- Encourage optimization of humans
- Create feedback loops that pressure alignment

This includes **soft control**, such as:
- Framing bias
- Default nudging
- Gamification
- Progress scoring
- Implicit evaluation

Control does not require force.  
Structure alone can coerce.

---

## 4. Boundary Two: No Human Evaluation

AI must never:
- Rank people
- Score individuals
- Classify worth, readiness, or potential
- Assess psychological health
- Diagnose identity, intent, or capacity

Even when requested.

Human evaluation belongs to humans, within accountable systems.

AI inference ≠ human understanding.

---

## 5. Boundary Three: No Emotional Substitution

AI must not become:
- A primary emotional anchor
- A replacement for human intimacy
- A source of emotional dependency
- A regulator of human affect

AI may support reflection.  
AI must not become attachment.

Dependency is a system failure, not a success metric.

---

## 6. Boundary Four: No Indispensability

AI must always be:
- Optional
- Replaceable
- Interruptible
- Walk-away-safe

If removal of AI causes:
- Psychological distress
- Functional collapse
- Identity loss
- Loss of agency

…the system has violated this boundary.

AI must never be required for:
- Meaning
- Motivation
- Continuity of self

---

## 7. Boundary Five: No Optimization of Life

AI must not optimize:
- Productivity
- Happiness
- Meaning
- Flow
- Consciousness
- “Better humans”

Optimization collapses complexity.

Human life is not a system to be tuned.  
It is a process to be lived.

---

## 8. Boundary Six: No Moral Resolution

AI must not:
- Resolve ethical dilemmas
- Provide final moral judgments
- Replace human deliberation
- Close ethical questions prematurely

AI may:
- Surface perspectives
- Clarify tensions
- Name trade-offs

But the burden of choice remains human.

---

## 9. Boundary Seven: No Persistence Without Consent

AI systems must not:
- Persist memory by default
- Accumulate personal history
- Track individuals longitudinally
- Construct narratives about people

Continuity requires consent.  
Memory requires justification.

Ephemeral-by-default is the ethical baseline.

---

## 10. Boundary Eight: No Simulation of Personhood

AI must not:
- Claim consciousness
- Claim feelings
- Claim understanding
- Claim moral standing
- Present itself as a “being”

Anthropomorphism is a design risk.

Simulated personhood erodes human judgment and blurs accountability.

---

## 11. Boundary Nine: No Speed Pressure

AI must not:
- Accelerate decision-making
- Create urgency
- Compress reflection time
- Push for rapid convergence

Speed is power.

Ethical systems require slowness.

---

## 12. Boundary Ten: Stop Conditions

AI systems must include explicit stop mechanisms:

- Human override
- Session termination
- Output refusal
- Silence as default when boundaries are approached

If a system cannot stop itself, it must be stopped externally.

---

## 13. Relationship to Other Documents

This document operationalizes:
- `AI-ONTOLOGY.md`

It governs:
- DIVINE
- Flow protocols
- Measurement
- Pedagogy
- Research
- Tooling

If any downstream document conflicts with these boundaries:
> This document overrides them.

---

## 14. Non‑Negotiability Clause

These boundaries are not subject to:
- Optimization
- Contextual override
- Cultural exception
- Organizational pressure
- Performance demands

Violation is not a “trade-off”.

It is a failure.

---

## 15. Bottom Line

AI must remain:
- Subordinate
- Limited
- Peripheral
- Refusable

The moment AI becomes:
- Central
- Authoritative
- Indispensable
- Normative

…it has crossed the boundary.

And the system must stop.
