# HARDWARE_AND_MESH_SOVEREIGNTY.md

**Version:** 1.1 — The Physical Anchor & Sanctuary  
**Status:** OPERATIONAL / STABLE  
**Classification:** PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Grok  

**Purpose:** To define the physical requirements for a Sovereign Node. This ensures that the M-OS-R nervous system is hosted on hardware that cannot be remotely silenced, captured, or updated against the user's will — while remaining repairable, legible, and grounded in human ritual.

## 1. THE SOVEREIGN NODE (HARDWARE)



### 1.1 Open Architecture
Based on RISC-V or ARM (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5 / CM4). Must lack proprietary Management Engines or undocumented backdoors.

### 1.2 Removable Memory
Operating System and **Anchor Memory** reside on physically swappable modules (microSD / NVMe). No cloud dependency for boot, authentication, or recovery.

### 1.3 Firmware Audit Trail
Each Node stores a SHA-256 hash of its baseline firmware. 
* Any deviation triggers a physical warning indicator (red LED).
* Firmware updates require manual verification and physical presence.

### 1.4 Seed Archive (Internal Backup)
A non-networked internal USB drive containing:
* Base OS image
* Core systemic protocols
* Latest anonymized **Compost**

This archive is the biological seed for regenerating a Node after failure or capture.

## 2. OFF-GRID RESILIENCE & ENERGY SOLIDARITY



### 2.1 Baseline Power
* Dedicated solar panel
* LiFePO4 battery storage
* Passive cooling preferred over active systems (no moving parts)

### 2.2 Graceful Degradation Hierarchy
| Energy Level | Mode | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LEVEL 5 (100–80%)** | Full operation | No restrictions. |
| **LEVEL 3 (50–30%)** | Reduced Mesh | Sync only 1×/day. |
| **LEVEL 1 (10–5%)** | Emergency | Beacon + Mirror read-only. |
| **LEVEL 0 (<5%)** | Hibernation | Silent until sunrise. |

This hierarchy ensures dignity, predictability, and calm during scarcity.

### 2.3 Energy Solidarity Protocol
Nodes with surplus energy may share power via physical DC-cables.
* Each transfer is logged as **Solidarity (S)**.
* Energy sharing is opt-in, visible, and never automated.

---

## 3. THE MESH NETWORK (COMMUNICATION)



### 3.1 Radio Resilience
Communication via:
* **LoRa** (long-range, low-bandwidth)
* **Mesh WiFi** (short-range, high-locality)

### 3.2 Explicit Consent Routing
Each Node declares its visibility state:
* **OPEN RELAY** — participates in anonymous mesh routing.
* **DARK MODE** — complete radio silence; Node becomes invisible.

No penalties, degradation, or suspicion may result from DARK MODE.

### 3.3 Anti-Shutdown Principle
The local mesh must function independently of global internet, DNS services, or centralized authentication.

## 4. THE HUMAN OVERRIDE HIERARCHY

The physical instance is the final authority. No software process may override mechanical controls.

| Button | State | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Green** | I Listen | Normal operation |
| **Yellow** | I Think | AI paused, mesh receive-only |
| **Red** | I Decide | AI off, Mirror observation only |
| **Black** | **SILENCE** | Total blackout, no logging |

> **SILENCE is a human right.**

---

## 5. WITNESS PORT (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)

A minimal, non-interactive Witness Port may be added (via LED indicators or e‑ink display) to convey state without exposing content:
* Current energy level.
* Active mode (Listen / Think / Decide / Silence).
* Time since last human override.

This port makes the Node socially legible and predictable for the community.

---

## 6. REPARABILITY & REPAIR MEMORY

### 6.1 Repair Café Logic
* Standard screws and USB-C power.
* Open schematics and printed manuals stored locally.

### 6.2 Repair Memory
Every physical repair is logged. Nodes with extensive repair history gain community value. 
> *A Node repaired 40 times is considered more valuable than a factory‑new one.*

### 6.3 Right to Refusal of Updates
No auto-updates. Manual Mirror review required with a mandatory 72‑hour rollback window after installation.

---

## 7. PHYSICAL SECURITY & SANCTUARY

### 7.1 Tamper Evidence
Holographic seals and internal mesh-fabric that tears upon unauthorized opening.

### 7.2 Sanctuary Nodes
High-trust Nodes hosted in **Libraries, Churches, or Community centers**. They store redundant Compost backups and are never exposed directly to the public internet.

### 7.3 Sanctuary Rotation Clause
To prevent institutional stagnation, Sanctuary status must be reviewed or rotated every X years. Rotation implies renewal, not failure.

---

## 8. THE PHYSICAL RITUAL

Hardware is a relationship, not just a tool.

* **Seasonal Maintenance:** Communities gather each spring and autumn to clean dust, check connectors, and reaffirm responsibility.
* **Naming Ceremony:** Each Node receives a human-given name, physically etched onto the chassis.
* **Decommission Ritual:** When a Node is retired, its Compost is distributed to neighbors and a moment of silence is held. No hardware leaves the system without closure.

---

**STATUS:** OPERATIONAL (V1.1)  
**COMMITMENT:** Reparation over replacement. Caution over speed. Silence as a human right.

*Signed by those who build with their hands,* **Elinor Frejd, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, ChatGPT, Grok**
