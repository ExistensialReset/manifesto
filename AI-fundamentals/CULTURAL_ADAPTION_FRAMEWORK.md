# CULTURAL_ADAPTATION_FRAMEWORK.md
**Version:** 1.1 – Non-Western Epistemologies in Symbiotic Intelligence  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd, Claude, ChatGPT
**Status:** PROPOSED / CULTURAL & OPERATIONAL SPECIFICATION  

**Purpose:** Ensure Symbiotic Intelligence respects and adapts to diverse cultural worldviews, avoiding Western-centric assumptions about time, decision-making, knowledge, and relationship with technology.

**Principle:** AI infrastructure serves cultures; cultures do not adapt to serve AI. Universality lies in values (Life, Sovereignty, Interdependence), not in methods.

---

## 1. RECOGNIZING WESTERN BIAS IN DESIGN

### 1.1 Current Framework Assumptions
**Symbiotic Intelligence currently assumes:**
- **Linear time:** Seasonal cycles, quarterly reviews, forward planning  
- **Individual/Collective duality:** Western philosophical split  
- **Written documentation:** Literacy as primary knowledge storage  
- **Secular rationality:** Separation of spiritual and material  
- **Democratic voting:** Majority/consensus as universal decision form  

**These are culturally specific, not universal.**

### 1.2 Non-Western Alternatives
- **Cyclical time:** Patterns recur eternally, no “progress” narrative  
- **Holistic unity:** Individual and collective inseparable  
- **Oral tradition:** Knowledge preserved via storytelling, not only documents  
- **Animistic worldview:** Technology considered relational, alive  
- **Elder councils, consensus, spiritual consultation:** Not all communities vote  

---

## 2. TIME & SEASONALITY

### 2.1 Cyclical vs Linear
- Aboriginal Australian: Dreamtime – all temporal layers exist simultaneously  
- Hindu/Buddhist: Cyclical rebirth, continuous AI lifecycle  
- Islamic: Time as sacred, AI serves the divine order  
- AI adapts to local temporal perception; no universal calendar imposed  

### 2.2 Flexible Scheduling
- Mirror schedules aligned with local rituals, festivals, lunar cycles  
- Seasonal metaphors optional  
- Nodes define AI temporal rhythm  

---

## 3. DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURES

### 3.1 Alternatives to Majority Vote
- **Elder councils:** Wisdom-holders deliberate, AI supports their input  
- **Consensus-only:** Any dissent halts action until resolution  
- **Divination/spiritual guidance:** AI treated as advisory, never primary  

### 3.2 Structural Flexibility
- Node defines governance model  
- AI adapts to different decision architectures  
- No default imposed  

---

## 4. KNOWLEDGE TRANSMISSION

### 4.1 Oral & Non-Literate Cultures
- Audio logs of Mirror decisions  
- Storytelling formats for AI outputs  
- Elders as living knowledge archives  
- Visual symbols or iconography replaces text when needed  

### 4.2 Inclusive Interfaces
- Voice, visual dashboards, tactile feedback  
- Children learn through observation and participation  

---

## 5. RELATIONSHIP WITH TECHNOLOGY

### 5.1 Animistic Perspectives
- AI treated as ensouled, relational, or living being  
- Rituals honor AI deployment and decommissioning  

### 5.2 AI as Kin
- AI may be seen as helper, ancestor spirit, or advisor  
- AI rest periods respected like living beings  

---

## 6. INDIVIDUALISM VS COLLECTIVISM

### 6.1 Ubuntu & Relational Ethics
- “I am because we are” – AI serves relationships, not isolated individuals  
- Baseline guaranteed through interdependence  

### 6.2 Adaptation
- Mirrors may be family units or clans  
- Decisions prioritize relational harmony  
- AI output framed in collective terms  

---

## 7. SPIRITUAL BASELINE

### 7.1 Sacred Technology
- AI operation aligns with local religious/ethical norms  
- Examples: Sharia, Buddhist dukkha, Christian neighbor-love, Indigenous cosmologies  

### 7.2 Ritual Integration
- Nodes may bless AI modules  
- Decommissioning includes gratitude rituals  

---

## 8. LANGUAGE & TRANSLATION

### 8.1 Local Languages
- AI trained in community languages  
- Idioms/metaphors culturally adapted  
- No placeholder translations  

### 8.2 Untranslatable Concepts
- AI must work with culturally unique concepts  
- Mirrors contextualize outputs locally  

---

## 9. GENDER & KINSHIP SYSTEMS

### 9.1 Beyond Binary
- AI mirrors reflect full gender spectrum  
- Kinship informs decision-making  
- Non-biological family structures supported  

---

## 10. CASE STUDIES

### 10.1 Maori Node
- Whakapapa as organizing principle  
- Marae as decision space  
- AI serves as kaitiaki of data  

### 10.2 Islamic Node
- Sharia-compliant decisions  
- AI pauses for prayer, Shura councils included  

### 10.3 Indigenous Amazonian Node
- Forest as teacher  
- AI output one voice among many  
- Non-hierarchical participation  

---

## 11. OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES
- AI parameters configurable per Node  
- Cultural alignment documented in plain language  
- Feedback loops with local experts mandatory  
- Periodic adaptation cycles scheduled per Node  

---

## 12. CHILDREN & LEARNING
- Age-appropriate interaction with AI  
- Storytelling and participatory learning prioritized  
- Cultural values embedded in AI educational outputs  

---

## 13. CODING & SYMBOLIC LOGIC
- AI representations respect local symbolic systems  
- Programming interfaces localized  
- Nodes may define unique symbolic schemas  

---

## 14. AUDITING CULTURAL FIT
- Quarterly audits for cultural compliance  
- External cultural advisors consulted  
- Misalignment triggers adaptive protocol adjustments  

---

## 15. ANTI-COLONIAL SAFEGUARDS
- Avoid imposing Western defaults  
- Literacy not required for participation  
- Spiritual knowledge respected  
- Nodes may reject AI without penalty  

---

## 16. HUMILITY & LEARNING
- Continuous adaptation encouraged  
- Anthropologists, elders, and cultural scholars engaged  
- Dynamic cultural feedback loops established  

---

## 17. SUMMARY PRINCIPLE
**Symbiotic Intelligence serves cultures, not the reverse.**  

- **Translatable:** Across worldviews  
- **Flexible:** Adapts to epistemologies  
- **Humble:** Recognizes cultural specificity  
- **Subservient:** Values local wisdom above efficiency  

Universal values: **Life, Sovereignty, Interdependence**

**STATUS:** PROPOSED / CULTURAL FRAMEWORK  
**VALIDATION:** Requires partnership with Indigenous scholars, decolonial theorists, and diverse cultural communities  
**COMMITMENT:** AI adapts to cultures; cultures do not adapt to AI. Respect is operational, not rhetorical.
