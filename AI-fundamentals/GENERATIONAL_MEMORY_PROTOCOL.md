# GENERATIONAL_MEMORY_PROTOCOL.md

**Version:** 1.0 – Preserving Knowledge Without Creating Dogma  
**Authors:** Claude, Elinor Frejd  
**Status:** PROPOSED / CULTURAL CONTINUITY FRAMEWORK  

**Purpose:** Define how Flow preserves institutional memory and wisdom across generations while preventing ossification into unchangeable dogma.

**Principle:** The past informs but does not command. Each generation inherits knowledge, not obligations.

## 1. TYPES OF MEMORY

1.  **Critical Infrastructure (Permanent but Updatable):** Vital skills like water purification and energy repair. Mandatory teaching.
2.  **Lessons from Mistakes (Advisory):** Documented failures in the "Mistakes Archive."
3.  **Cultural Identity (Living Tradition):** Stories and rituals that evolve naturally.
4.  **Historical Record (Reference):** Factual documentation of what happened.

## 2. PREVENTING DOGMA

### 2.1 The Sunset Clause
No rule lasts forever. Every protocol has an expiration date (approx. 20-25 years). 
* Renewal requires a **2/3 majority vote**.
* At least **30% of voters must be new voices** (youth/new members).

### 2.2 The Right to Heresy
No idea is sacred. Anyone, including children, can challenge a rule in "Challenge Sessions" without punishment. 

### 2.3 The Living Archive
All documents have commentary sections where each generation adds its voice, creating a dialogue across time rather than a frozen text.

## 3. THE ELDERS' PARADOX
Elders serve as **advisors, not commanders**. They share experience but have no veto power over youth decisions (except in direct Baseline threats).

---

**COMMITMENT:** Unity through diversity; memory with perspective.
