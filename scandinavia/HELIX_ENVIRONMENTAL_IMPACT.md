# HELIX Environmental Impact Assessment (LCA)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Synced with Budget V2.9  
**Date:** 2026-01-28

## 1. Carbon Footprint & Sequestration
* **Mycelium Construction:** Replaces traditional concrete/steel. Estimated carbon sequestration of 5 tons of $CO_2$ per year.
* **Net Reduction:** 50% lower $CO_2$ footprint compared to standard Swedish residential builds (verified against RISE/Boverket benchmarks).
* **Energy:** Passive solar heating + LED optimization reduces grid dependency by 40%.

## 2. Water & Biodiversity
* **Circular Systems:** 60% water recycling rate via the Ocean module (graywater to hydroponics).
* **Biodiversity Gain:** +20% local species density through integrated beehives and mussel filtration systems in the Ocean unit.
* **Pollinators:** 10 hives support local flora within a 3km radius.

## 3. Resilience Metrics
* **Waste Management:** Zero-waste goal through anaerobic digestion of organic yields.
* **Climate Adaptation:** Humidity sensors and open-source IoT prevent structural decay, ensuring a 100+ year building lifecycle.
