# HELIX Permanence & Anti-Capture Framework
**Version:** 1.0  
**Legal Basis:** Swedish Association Law (Ekonomisk förening) + Land Lease Covenants  
**Objective:** Ensure the HELIX Node remains a permanent commons; cannot be sold, demutualized, or exploited for profit.

---

## ⚖️ 1. The "Non-Profit" Lockdown (Asset Lock)
> **Clause:** Upon dissolution of the association, all residual assets — including land lease rights, biological systems, and infrastructure — must transfer to a pre-defined "Federation of Resilient Nodes" or a designated Land Trust.  
> **Effect:** No individual member or external buyer may ever realize capital gain. The value remains in the system, preserving social and ecological purpose.

---

## 🛡️ 2. Step-In Rights (Governance Pill)
> **Clause:** If an external creditor or entity attempts control due to financial distress, an automatic "M-OS-R Emergency State" is triggered.  
> **Effect:** Decision-making shifts to a decentralized council of other HELIX nodes. The attempting entity gains control of hardware but cannot operate or manage without digital keys held collectively.

---

## 🐚 3. The "Biological Hostage" Covenant
> **Clause:** Maintenance of Ocean and Mycelium modules is legally tied to residency permits.  
> **Effect:** Any commercial entity acquiring the building must maintain complex, high-cost biological systems. Without resident labor, costs exceed potential rental profits, discouraging exploitative purchase.

---

## 🏠 4. Land Lease "Social Clause"
> **Clause:** The 99-year lease with Göteborg Stad is contingent on rent caps linked to local CPI (currently 8,000 SEK).  
> **Effect:** Attempted rent increases to market rates (~13,000 SEK) breach the lease, reverting property control to the City or Trust, destroying potential profit for predatory investors.

---

## 🔐 5. Digital Sovereignty (M-OS-R Lock)
> **Clause:** Operational software (Climate, Water, Security systems) is licensed under a "Non-Commercial Commons" agreement.  
> **Effect:** Any commercial attempt to use HELIX tech stack for profit incurs a "Prohibitive License Fee" (e.g., 500% of revenue) payable to HELIX Global Trust.

---

## 📋 6. Enforcement & Governance Notes
* **Monitoring:** HELIX nodes maintain regular audits of compliance with asset lock and biological maintenance clauses.  
* **Fallback:** Step-In Rights ensure continuity even under financial or legal attack.  
* **Transparency:** All legal documents, leases, and operational protocols are publicly recorded in the HELIX Master Trust Registry.

---

## 🚀 7. Strategic Impact
* **Security:** Project becomes resistant to hostile takeovers and speculative real estate exploitation.  
* **Social Permanence:** Ensures the building and infrastructure remain devoted to affordable housing, food resilience, and mental health infrastructure.  
* **Political Credibility:** Demonstrates to Göteborg Stad and EU funders that HELIX is a permanent, legally safeguarded commons.

**Summary:**  
HELIX is designed to **remain a permanent social and ecological commons**.  
This framework locks assets, enforces governance, ties biological and digital systems to residency, and protects against predatory profit motives.  
The combination of **legal ⚖️, biological 🐚, and digital 🔐 barriers** ensures **resilience, social value, and operational sovereignty** for decades to come.
