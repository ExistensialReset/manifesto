# HELIX_NODE  
## A Scalable Model for Social Housing, Preventive Health and Resource Resilience

HELIX_NODE is a non-profit housing and care infrastructure prototype designed to reduce long-term public expenditure in healthcare, social services, and emergency housing.

It integrates affordable housing, mental health prevention, and circular resource systems into one replicable model.

## The Challenge

Across Europe, public systems face:

- rising healthcare and mental health costs  
- increasing long-term sick leave and disability claims  
- housing shortages for vulnerable populations  
- fragmented and reactive welfare interventions  

Current approaches treat symptoms rather than system design.

## The HELIX_NODE Solution

HELIX_NODE reframes housing as preventive infrastructure.

Key components include:

- **Fully accessible cooperative housing** for residents excluded from the conventional housing market  
- **Built-in mental health recovery environments**, reducing reliance on acute care services  
- **Circular food and resource systems**, lowering living costs and external dependency  
- **Fixed and predictable living costs**, increasing long-term stability and autonomy

## Impact & Return on Investment

- Reduced long-term healthcare and social service expenditure  
- Lower reliance on institutional and emergency placements  
- Improved health outcomes through prevention rather than intervention  
- A cost-efficient, evidence-informed alternative to fragmented welfare models  

HELIX_NODE is designed as a living pilot, generating data for policy evaluation, research, and replication.
