# HELIX NODE  
## Speech Script – City of Gothenburg & European Union

---

### Introduction

HELIX NODE addresses a structural gap in contemporary urban development.

Across Europe and in Gothenburg, we are seeing rising mental health challenges, loneliness and social fragmentation, while housing, healthcare and social systems remain siloed and largely reactive.

---

### The Challenge

Current systems are under increasing pressure due to:
- Growing healthcare and social service costs
- High reliance on emergency interventions
- Lack of preventive, place-based solutions

There is a missing link between:
**housing – community – health – civil society**

---

### What HELIX NODE Is

HELIX NODE is neither a traditional housing project nor a healthcare facility.

It is **preventive urban infrastructure** that:
- Integrates accessible housing
- Enables voluntary community
- Applies nature-based and regenerative systems
- Creates soft institutional cooperation

---

### Design Logic

HELIX NODE follows the principle:

**Q × S × I**  
Quality of Life × Social Sustainability × Institutional Integration

The architecture is designed to:
- Reduce everyday stress
- Prevent escalation into crisis
- Strengthen long-term human resilience

---

### Economic Rationale

HELIX NODE is not a cost — it is a **preventive investment**.

By reducing:
- Long-term care dependency
- Social isolation
- Crisis-driven interventions

…it lowers future public expenditure at both municipal and EU levels.

---

### Relevance to the EU and Gothenburg

The project aligns directly with:
- City of Gothenburg public health and equality strategies
- EU Green Deal
- New European Bauhaus
- EU Social Economy Action Plan

Gothenburg can serve as a **pilot city for a scalable EU model**.

### Closing / Our Request

We are seeking:
1. Structured dialogue
2. Cooperation for a pilot phase
3. Support for evaluation and scaling

The objective is a verified, replicable case for regenerative urban development with measurable societal impact.
