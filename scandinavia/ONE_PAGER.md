## THE PROBLEM

**Sweden's housing system is failing at a structural level:**

* **Wait times:** 9.2-year average for a rental (Göteborg, 2025).
* **Cost of living:** ~13,000 SEK/month (rent + utilities + food for 60m²).
* **Mental health:** Psychiatric ER visits up 40% since 2019; 6+ hour wait times.
* **Vulnerability:** Urban food import dependency at ~50%.

These pressures translate directly into rising public costs for healthcare, emergency services, and temporary housing.

**Conventional solutions are too slow, too siloed, or too expensive.**  
HELIX addresses housing, mental health, food security, and climate resilience simultaneously by designing buildings as living systems rather than profit-extraction machines.

## THE SOLUTION: HELIX NODE GÖTEBORG

### 29 Soul Dwellings

* 60 m² private units, fully wheelchair-accessible.
* **Acoustics:** >40 dB sound isolation for sensory safety.
* **Autonomy:** Individual agency over one’s space (music, smoking, lifestyle), without impacting neighbors.

---

### The Ocean — Integrated Aquaponics

* 20 m³ closed-loop biological system (fish, cuttlefish, mussels, plants).
* **Yield:** ~4,800 kg food/year, covering ~70% of residents’ needs.
* Based on validated models from FAO, RISE Sweden, and SLU research.

---

### Refugium Anima — Crisis Sanctuary

* 24/7 non-coercive sanctuary; no questions asked, no documentation required.
* **Rooms:**
  * Cry Room (accessible bathtub, sound isolation)
  * Silent Room (sensory rest and darkness)
  * Creation Room (art, play, emotional regulation)
* **Impact target:** Up to 60% reduction in psychiatric ER visits for residents.

Refugium Anima is not a clinic or treatment facility. It is preventive social infrastructure that reduces escalation before crises require public intervention.
