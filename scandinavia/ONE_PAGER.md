# 🏛️ HELIX_NODE — ONE PAGER
## Living Architecture for a Healing Future

**Location:** Masthuggskajen, Göteborg, Sweden  
**Timeline:** Prototype Q2 2026 → Full Build 2027-2030

## 💡 THE PROBLEM

**Housing today extracts wealth and isolates people:**
- Average rent (60m²): 9,000+ kr/month (leaving little for life)
- Inaccessible for wheelchairs, chronic illness, neurodivergence
- Food/energy dependence on fragile supply chains
- Loneliness epidemic despite proximity to neighbors

**People pay to survive, not to live.**

---

## 🌿 THE SOLUTION: HELIX_NODE

**A cooperative living building that:**
- **Grows 82% of residents' food** (aquaponics, vertical gardens, bees)
- **Costs LESS than rent** (7,700 kr/month all-inclusive vs. 13,000+ kr conventional)
- **Adapts to all bodies** (ramps not stairs, soundproofing, sensory design)
- **Builds community without coercion** (private 60m² "Soul Dwellings" + optional commons)

---

## 🐙 HOW IT WORKS

### The Ocean (Heart of HELIX)
**20-meter vertical aquaponics system:**
- Octopi, prawns, salmon, mussels (6,000 kg protein/year)
- Biological water filtration
- Feeds hydroponic rice, coffee, fruits, vegetables

### Soul Dwellings (Private Sanctuaries)
**60m² units suspended from structure:**
- Vibration-isolated (no noise from neighbors)
- HEPA-filtered ventilation (smoke-safe if desired)
- Total acoustic privacy (>40 dB isolation)
- Accessible bathroom + guest room

### The Ramp (Accessibility as Architecture)
**4-meter-wide spiral (2% gradient):**
- Wheelchairs, walkers, strollers: all easy
- Lined with gardens (walking = immersion in nature)
- Primary emergency exit (no bottlenecks)

### Annual Production (30 residents)
- **Protein:** 6,000 kg (fish, octopus, mussels)
- **Coffee:** 500 kg (Arabica hybrid)
- **Fruits/Grains/Veg:** 22,500 kg
- **Honey:** 800 liters (10 beehives)

## 💰 ECONOMICS

### Total Cost: 160 MSEK (~$15M USD)

**Financing Mix:**
- EU Green Deal grants: -25 MSEK
- Göteborg Stad co-financing: -50 MSEK
- JAK Medlemsbank (0% interest loan): -30 MSEK
- Patient capital/donors: -15 MSEK
- Crowdfunding: -7.1 MSEK
- Resident sweat equity: -8 MSEK

**Net financing needed: 127 MSEK**

### Monthly Cost: 7,700 kr (all-inclusive)
**Includes:**
- Housing (60m² private)
- Utilities (energy, water, internet)
- 80% of food needs
- Maintenance

**Compare to:**
- Conventional rent: 9,000 kr
- Food: 3,000 kr
- Utilities: 1,000 kr
- **Total: 13,000 kr/month**

**HELIX = 5,300 kr/month SAVINGS**

## 🎯 WHO IT'S FOR

**People the system abandoned:**
- Wheelchair users, chronic illness, neurodivergence
- Low income, economic precarity
- Loneliness, isolation
- Families, elders, anyone seeking community

**Membership pathways (choose one or combine):**
1. **Sweat Equity:** 200 hours work over 2 years
2. **Sliding Scale:** Pay 0 – 200,000 kr based on capacity
3. **Temporal:** Contribute later when able

**Principle:** Housing is a right, not earned through wealth.

---

## 🧬 THE PHILOSOPHY: L × S × I

**L — Lugn (Calm):** Soundproofing, private control, baseline security  
**S — Spontanitet (Spontaneity):** Your space, your rules (smoke, music, harvest at 3 AM)  
**I — Inkännande (Empathy):** System protects all (clean air/water, conflict resolution)

**If any factor → 0, quality of life collapses. All three protected.**

---

## 🛡️ ANTI-CAPTURE PROTECTIONS

**HELIX cannot be:**
- Sold to investors for profit
- Converted to market-rate housing
- Franchised as real estate brand

**Legal safeguards:**
- Cooperative ownership (residents own together)
- CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (designs open-source, non-commercial)
- Mission lock (must remain affordable cooperative)

---

## 📅 TIMELINE

**Q2 2026:** Prototype (1:10 scale) — test systems, learn, iterate  
**Q3 2027:** Break ground at Masthuggskajen  
**2027-2029:** Construction (mycelium, Soul Dwellings, Ocean)  
**Q1 2030:** First residents move in  
**Q2 2030:** Full occupancy (30 residents) + first harvest celebration  
**2030+:** Replication to other cities (open-source model)
