# 🏛️ HELIX_NODE — ONE PAGER
## Living Architecture for a Healing Future

**Location:** Masthuggskajen, Göteborg, Sweden  
**Timeline:** Prototype Q2 2026 → Full Build 2027-2030

## 💡 THE PROBLEM

**Housing today extracts wealth, isolates people, and abandons those in crisis:**
- Average rent (60m²): 9,000+ kr/month (leaving little for life)
- Inaccessible for wheelchairs, chronic illness, neurodivergence
- Food/energy dependence on fragile supply chains
- Mental health crisis = hospital (traumatic) or police (criminalizing)
- Loneliness epidemic despite proximity to neighbors

**People pay to survive, not to live.**

---

## 🌿 THE SOLUTION: HELIX_NODE

**A cooperative living building that:**
- **Grows 82% of residents' food** (aquaponics, vertical gardens, bees)
- **Costs LESS than rent** (7,970 kr/month all-inclusive vs. 13,000+ kr conventional)
- **Includes crisis sanctuary** (Refugium Anima — dedicated mental health space)
- **Adapts to all bodies** (ramps not stairs, soundproofing, sensory design)
- **Builds community without coercion** (private 60m² "Soul Dwellings" + optional commons)

---

## 🐙 HOW IT WORKS

### The Ocean (Heart of HELIX)
**20-meter vertical aquaponics system:**
- Octopi, prawns, salmon, mussels (6,000 kg protein/year)
- Biological water filtration
- Feeds hydroponic rice, coffee, fruits, vegetables

### Soul Dwellings (Private Sanctuaries)
**29 units of 60m² each, suspended from structure:**
- Vibration-isolated (no noise from neighbors)
- HEPA-filtered ventilation (smoke-safe if desired)
- Total acoustic privacy (>40 dB isolation)
- Accessible bathroom + guest room

### Refugium Anima (The 30th Unit)
**60m² dedicated crisis sanctuary:**

**Not a hospital. Not a clinic. A sanctuary.**

**Three Rooms:**
1. **Cry Room:** Accessible bathtub, warm water 24/7, weighted blankets
2. **Silent Room:** Beds/hammocks, total darkness option, temperature control
3. **Creation Room:** Art supplies, music, gentle activities

**Access:**
- Open to all residents 24/7
- No justification needed
- No time limit (standard: 7 days)
- Privacy absolute (no tracking)

**Why it matters:**
- Prevents crises from escalating to ER/police
- Costs pennies vs. one hospital visit (15,000+ kr)
- Proactive mental health infrastructure

### The Ramp (Accessibility as Architecture)
**4-meter-wide spiral (2% gradient):**
- Wheelchairs, walkers, strollers: all easy
- Lined with gardens (walking = immersion in nature)
- Primary emergency exit (no bottlenecks)

### Annual Production (29 residents)
- **Protein:** 6,000 kg (fish, octopus, mussels)
- **Coffee:** 500 kg (Arabica hybrid)
- **Fruits/Grains/Veg:** 22,500 kg
- **Honey:** 800 liters (10 beehives)

**82% food self-sufficiency**

## 💰 ECONOMICS

### Total Cost: 160 MSEK (~$15M USD)

**Financing Mix:**
- EU Green Deal grants: -25 MSEK
- Göteborg Stad co-financing: -50 MSEK
- JAK Medlemsbank (0% interest loan): -30 MSEK
- Patient capital/donors: -15 MSEK
- Crowdfunding: -7.1 MSEK
- Resident sweat equity: -8 MSEK

**Net financing needed: 127 MSEK**

### Monthly Cost: 7,970 kr (all-inclusive)

**Why 7,970 kr (not 7,700)?**
- 29 residential units (not 30) — costs divided among fewer people
- Refugium Anima requires utilities, supplies, maintenance
- Still **5,030 kr/month cheaper** than conventional living

**Includes:**
- Housing (60m² private Soul Dwelling)
- Utilities (energy, water, internet)
- 80% of food needs
- **Access to Refugium Anima** (mental health sanctuary)
- All maintenance

**Compare to:**
- Conventional rent: 9,000 kr
- Food: 3,000 kr
- Utilities: 1,000 kr
- **Total: 13,000 kr/month**

**HELIX = 5,030 kr/month SAVINGS**

**Over 10 years: 603,600 kr saved per person**

## 🎯 WHO IT'S FOR

**People the system abandoned:**
- Wheelchair users, chronic illness, neurodivergence
- Mental health conditions (bipolar, C-PTSD, autism, etc.)
- Low income, economic precarity
- Anyone who's been in crisis with nowhere to go
- Families, elders, anyone seeking community

**Membership pathways (choose one or combine):**
1. **Sweat Equity:** 200 hours work over 2 years
2. **Sliding Scale:** Pay 0 – 200,000 kr based on capacity
3. **Temporal:** Contribute later when able

**Principle:** Housing is a right, not earned through wealth.

---

## 🧬 THE PHILOSOPHY: L × S × I

**L — Lugn (Calm):** Soundproofing, private control, baseline security, Refugium Anima for regulation  
**S — Spontanitet (Spontaneity):** Your space your rules, use Refugium Anima anytime without asking  
**I — Inkännande (Empathy):** System protects all (clean air/water, conflict resolution, crisis support)

**If any factor → 0, quality of life collapses. All three protected.**

---

## 🛡️ ANTI-CAPTURE PROTECTIONS

**HELIX cannot be:**
- Sold to investors for profit
- Converted to market-rate housing
- Franchised as real estate brand

**Legal safeguards:**
- Cooperative ownership (residents own together)
- CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (designs open-source, non-commercial)
- Mission lock (must remain affordable cooperative)

**Refugium Anima design is open-source** — anyone can build crisis sanctuaries.

---

## 📅 TIMELINE

**Q2 2026:** Prototype (1:10 scale) — test systems including mini Refugium Anima  
**Q3 2027:** Break ground at Masthuggskajen  
**2027-2029:** Construction (mycelium, 29 Soul Dwellings, Refugium Anima, Ocean)  
**Q1 2030:** First residents move in, Refugium Anima opens  
**Q2 2030:** Full occupancy (29 residents) + first crisis successfully supported  
**2030+:** Replication to other cities (open-source model)

## 🌍 THE VISION

**HELIX proves:**

**By 2035:** HELIX nodes (with Refugium Anima) in every major Scandinavian city.

**This is not utopia. It's just good design.**

## 🏥 REFUGIUM ANIMA: THE DIFFERENCE

**Traditional crisis response:**
- Hospital ER: 6+ hour wait, traumatic, 15,000+ kr

**HELIX crisis response:**
- Walk to Refugium Anima (2 minutes from your room)
- Cry in accessible bathtub, sleep in silence, create with clay
- Return to Flow when ready
- Cost: 0 kr (included in monthly fee)

**Societal savings (per resident/year):**
- Prevented hospitalizations: ~50,000 kr
- Reduced medication needs: ~15,000 kr
