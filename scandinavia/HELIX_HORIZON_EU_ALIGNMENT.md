# HELIX_HORIZON_EU_ALIGNMENT.md
## Alignment with Horizon Europe Calls & EU Policy Frameworks

**Document type:** EU Call Alignment Brief  
**Target audience:** Horizon Europe evaluators, EU Commission reviewers, public innovation agencies  
**Purpose:** Demonstrate policy fit, impact logic, and implementation readiness

## 1. PROJECT SUMMARY

HELIX_NODE is a modular, building-integrated resilience system combining:
- Local water recycling and purification
- Advanced indoor air filtration
- Circular biological systems
- Human-centered spatial design

HELIX transforms residential buildings into decentralized resilience infrastructure, reducing systemic pressure on municipal utilities while improving public health outcomes.

---

## 2. RELEVANCE TO HORIZON EUROPE PILLARS

### Pillar II – Global Challenges & European Industrial Competitiveness

HELIX directly addresses challenges within:
- **Cluster 5: Climate, Energy and Mobility**
- **Cluster 6: Food, Bioeconomy, Natural Resources, Agriculture and Environment**
- **Cluster 2: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society**

---

## 3. POLICY ALIGNMENT

HELIX is aligned with:
- European Green Deal
- New European Bauhaus
- EU Circular Economy Action Plan
- Urban Resilience and Climate Adaptation Strategies
- Zero Pollution Action Plan

The project operationalizes policy objectives at building scale.

---

## 4. INNOVATION CHARACTER

HELIX does not introduce untested technologies.  
Innovation lies in **system integration**, governance logic, and real-time adaptive control.

Key characteristics:
- Multi-barrier safety architecture
- Fail-safe connection to existing municipal systems
- Sensor-driven monitoring and override capability

---

## 5. IMPACT PATHWAY

Expected measurable impacts:
- Up to 60% reduction in greywater discharge to municipal systems
- Significant improvement in indoor air quality
- Reduced urban infrastructure load
- Improved wellbeing and reduced stress indicators

Impact is local, quantifiable, and scalable.

---

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION READINESS

Technology Readiness Level (TRL):  
**Subsystems:** TRL 8–9  
**Integrated system:** TRL 6–7 (pilot phase)

HELIX is designed for:
- Living Labs
- Urban pilot districts
- Public-private innovation partnerships

---

## 7. SCALABILITY & REPLICATION

HELIX is:
- Modular
- Adaptable to different regulatory contexts
- Replicable across EU cities

Replication does not depend on site-specific natural conditions.

---

## 8. CONCLUSION

HELIX represents a low-risk, high-impact pathway for implementing EU resilience policy at the scale where citizens actually live.

It is not speculative innovation.  
It is applied European infrastructure.
