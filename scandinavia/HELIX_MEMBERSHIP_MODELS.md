## How to Become a Resident: Beyond Capital, Toward Contribution

**Document ID:** HELIX-MEMBERSHIP-v1.0  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd & Claude  
**Status:** ACTIVE / FOUNDATIONAL  
**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Principle:** L × S × I (Access through participation, not wealth)

---

## 📢 CORE PRINCIPLE

**In HELIX, membership is not bought — it is earned through participation, solidarity, and commitment to collective wellbeing.**

Traditional housing cooperatives require:
- Large capital deposits (50 000 - 500 000 kr)
- Proof of creditworthiness
- Employment stability
- Economic "respectability"

**This excludes:**
- People with chronic illness affecting work capacity
- People with debt (including medical, student, or survival debt)
- People living on disability support
- People abandoned by the system

**HELIX rejects this model entirely.**

## 🌿 THE THREE PATHWAYS TO MEMBERSHIP

Every resident can enter HELIX through **at least one** of these paths. Many will combine them.

---

### 🛠️ PATH 1: SWEAT EQUITY (The Labor Path)

**Principle:** Your time and skills are as valuable as money.

#### How It Works

**Standard Sweat Equity Agreement:**
- Contribute **200 hours** of documented labor over 24 months
- This "earns" your cooperative membership share
- You pay **only monthly costs** (7700 kr), no capital deposit required

#### What Counts as Sweat Equity?

**During Construction (2028-2029):**
- Physical building work (if able)
- Design/planning participation
- Documentation and knowledge-sharing
- Community organizing
- Fundraising/grant writing support
- Translation work (making HELIX accessible in multiple languages)

**After Completion (Ongoing):**
- Ocean system maintenance (feeding fish, monitoring water quality)
- Mycelium care and harvesting
- Vertical garden tending
- Shared meal preparation in communal kitchen
- Conflict mediation training and practice
- New resident orientation/mentorship
- Technical systems monitoring
- Educational workshops for visitors

#### Accessibility Considerations

**If you cannot do physical labor:**
- Cognitive work counts equally (documentation, design, education)
- Emotional labor counts (conflict resolution, care coordination)
- Administrative labor counts (scheduling, communication, organizing)

**If you can only contribute 2 hours/week:**
- That's fine. 2 hours × 52 weeks × 2 years = 208 hours (you're in)

**If you need to pause contributions due to health:**
- The clock stops. Resume when able.
- No penalty. No questions.

#### Documentation

Each member maintains a **Contribution Log** (not for surveillance, but for transparency):
- Date and type of contribution
- Hours invested
- Skills shared
- Optional: reflections on what you learned

**This log is:**
- Self-reported (honor system)
- Reviewed annually by Contribution Circle (not to police, but to ensure fairness)
- Private unless you choose to share

### 💰 PATH 2: SLIDING SCALE DEPOSIT (The Solidarity Path)

**Principle:** Those with more resources support those with less. No one is excluded due to poverty.

#### How It Works

Instead of fixed deposit, HELIX uses **ability-based contributions:**

| Economic Situation | Deposit Range | Monthly Cost |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **No assets, significant debt** | 0 kr | 7700 kr |
| **Minimal savings, paycheck-to-paycheck** | 0 - 10 000 kr | 7700 kr |
| **Some stability, small emergency fund** | 10 000 - 30 000 kr | 7700 kr |
| **Comfortable, able to save regularly** | 30 000 - 75 000 kr | 7700 kr |
| **High income/wealth, wants to support vision** | 75 000 - 200 000 kr | 7700 kr |

**Key Points:**
- All residents pay the **same monthly cost** (7700 kr)
- Deposit is one-time, ability-based contribution
- Higher deposits fund the **Solidarity Reserve** (see below)
- **No one is ranked or treated differently based on deposit amount**
- All residents have **equal voting rights** regardless of financial contribution

#### Solidarity Reserve Fund

Money from higher deposits creates a buffer that:
- Supports residents in temporary economic crisis
- Covers emergency repairs without raising monthly costs
- Funds accessibility modifications for new residents
- Enables zero-deposit entry for those who need it

**This is not charity. It is structural solidarity.**

---

### ⏳ PATH 3: TEMPORAL CONTRIBUTION (The Future Path)

**Principle:** You contribute what you can, when you can.

#### How It Works

**For those who:**
- Currently have zero financial capacity
- Cannot contribute 200 hours due to severe illness/disability
- Need immediate housing but lack both capital and labor capacity

**You can:**
1. **Enter with minimal/zero deposit** (covered by Solidarity Reserve)
2. **Commit to contribute when circumstances improve**
3. **Make voluntary contributions over time** (no fixed schedule)

#### What This Looks Like

**Example 1: Economic Recovery**
- Elinor enters HELIX with 0 kr deposit (Solidarity Reserve covers)
- 5 years later, her financial situation stabilizes
- She voluntarily contributes 20 000 kr to Solidarity Reserve
- This helps future residents in her situation

**Example 2: Capacity Fluctuation**
- Resident has bipolar disorder (like Elinor)
- During manic phases: contributes labor (gardening, organizing)
- During depressive phases: contributes nothing
- Over 5 years, averages 100 hours/year = membership earned

**Example 3: Skill Development**
- Resident enters unable to contribute much
- Learns aquaponics system maintenance over 2 years
- Becomes expert, trains new residents
- This teaching = high-value contribution

**No timeline. No pressure. No eviction for non-contribution.**

## 🛡️ PROTECTIONS AGAINST EXPLOITATION

### Anti-Freeloader Safeguard (Without Being Cruel)

**Reality:** Some people might try to exploit the generosity.

**HELIX response:**
- Annual **Contribution Review** (not judgment, just check-in)
- If someone has capacity but consistently contributes nothing: gentle conversation
- "We notice you haven't engaged in any communal activities. Is everything okay? How can we support you to participate?"

**If pattern continues:**
- Mediation circle (not punishment, but clarity)
- "HELIX works because we all contribute. What would make participation possible for you?"

**Last resort (very rare):**
- If someone is actively hostile to collective wellbeing AND refuses all engagement:
- They can remain housed (Baseline protected)
- But may lose voting rights or access to certain communal resources
- **They are never made homeless**

## 🌊 SPECIAL CASES

### For People Like Elinor

**Situation:**
- 0 kr savings
- Debt with Kronofogden (bailiff)
- 11 000 kr/month income
- 9 000 kr rent (leaving 2000 kr for everything else)
- Chronic conditions (Bipolar Type 1, Diabetes Type 1, wheelchair user)

**HELIX Path:**
1. **Enter via PATH 1 (Sweat Equity) + PATH 3 (Temporal)**
2. Contribute design work (already done — worth millions if invoiced)
3. Contribute documentation and education (ongoing)
4. Pay 7700 kr/month (LESS than current 9000 kr + utilities + food)
5. **Net result: More money left over than now, living in what you built**

### For Undocumented People

**HELIX does not check immigration status.**

If Swedish law allows it (which it does for housing cooperatives):
- Membership based on contribution, not legal status
- No passport/ID required for residency
- Solidarity path available

**If legal barriers exist:**
- We work with migration solidarity organizations
- Explore "right to shelter" legal frameworks
- Prioritize human dignity over bureaucracy

### For People Fleeing Violence

**Immediate housing + deferred contribution:**
- Enter with zero deposit (Solidarity Reserve)
- No labor expectation during crisis recovery
- Support from Refugium Anima (mental health sanctuary)
- Contribution path opens when safe/ready

## 💚 FINAL WORDS

**Elinor Frejd should be able to live in HELIX.**

Not despite her poverty, debt, and disability.  
But **because HELIX exists to house people like her.**

If the designer of HELIX cannot live in it:  
**We have failed.**

If only the economically stable can join:  
**We have reproduced the system we sought to replace.**

**Membership is not bought.** **It is built together.**
