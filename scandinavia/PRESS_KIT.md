## THE HOOK (Why This Is A Story)

### The Logline

**A woman in Göteborg is building a house where octopi help pay the rent, mental breakdowns have their own room, and 29 strangers become economically interdependent — and it might just save the Swedish housing market.**

---

### Why Journalists Should Care (Pick Your Angle)

**For Göteborgs-Posten / Dagens Nyheter:**
* **Local angle:** Göteborg pilot project could solve Sweden's 9.2-year housing wait crisis.
* **Innovation:** First-in-world integration of aquaponics, mycelium architecture, and mental health infrastructure in residential cooperative.
* **Political relevance:** Tests whether EU Green Deal funding can actually deliver affordable housing (answer: yes, 8,200 SEK/month all-inclusive vs. 13,000 SEK market rate).

**For The Guardian / BBC / Der Spiegel:**
* **Global crisis, local solution:** Housing unaffordability is destroying Western cities — here's a model that actually works.
* **Climate angle:** Carbon-negative building that produces 70% of residents' food (4,800 kg/year from rooftop/integrated systems).
* **Mental health:** "Refugium Anima" — the crisis room that replaces psychiatric ERs (and saves municipalities €135,000/year per avoided hospitalization).

**For WIRED / The Verge / Dezeen:**
* **Bio-architecture:** Mycelium walls that breathe (hygroscopic moisture regulation, mold-resistant, biodegradable).
* **Tech innovation:** IoT sensor network monitors 100+ data points in real-time (humidity, water quality, energy flow) — digital twin simulation optimizes before building starts.
* **Future-facing:** This is what post-Airbnb, post-landlord housing looks like (cooperative ownership, open-source blueprints, replicable in 100 cities by 2035).

**For Vice / Jacobin / Novara Media:**
* **Anti-capitalist praxis:** "We're not fighting the housing market — we're making it irrelevant."
* **Solidarity economy:** No landlords, no investors extracting profit, member-owned with anti-capture bylaws.
* **Mental health abolitionism:** Replacing police/ER for mental health crises with "Refugium Anima" — 24/7 access, no questions, no coercion.

## THE NARRATIVE (Three Story Arcs)

### Arc 1: The Personal Journey (Human Interest)

**Protagonist:** Elinor Frejd, 39, disabled, exhausted by a system that demands she "fix herself" to deserve housing.

**The Problem:**
* Göteborg apartment wait: 9+ years.
* Can't afford market-rate rent + food + healthcare on disability income.
* Current housing: Inaccessible, isolated, unsustainable.

**The Breaking Point:**
> "I was sitting in my apartment at 3 AM, couldn't sleep because of neighbor noise, couldn't afford both rent and groceries, and I thought: What if I'm asking the wrong question? What if the problem isn't 'how do I survive this system' but 'how do I build a different system'?"

### Arc 2: The Technical Marvel (Innovation Story)

**The Octopi Angle:** (The hook that gets people reading)
Most buildings extract rent. This building **generates food**.

**The Twist:** The "Ocean" — a 20 m³ aquaponics system where fish, octopi, mussels, and plants form a closed-loop ecosystem.

**The Science:**
* 8 cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) produce 80 kg calamari/year.
* Their waste feeds bacteria → bacteria feed plants → plants filter water → clean water returns to cuttlefish.
* Result: 70% food self-sufficiency (4,800 kg/year for 29 people).

### Arc 3: The Mental Health Revolution (Social Impact Story)

**The Radical Idea:** What if we just... gave people a place to fall apart safely?

**Refugium Anima:** Three rooms, 24/7 access, zero questions asked.

1.  **Cry Room:** Accessible bathtub, soundproofed walls, adjustable lighting. Warm water reduces cortisol 18-24% within 30 minutes.
2.  **Silent Room:** Total darkness option, sensory deprivation to activate the glymphatic system.
3.  **Creation Room:** Art supplies, instruments, clay. Play bypasses trauma response and restores prefrontal cortex function.

**The Economics:**
* Cost per resident: 270 SEK/month.
* Projected impact: 60% reduction in crisis escalation.
* Municipal savings: 1.35 MSEK/year per node.

## PULL QUOTES (Ready for Headlines)

> **"Housing shouldn't be a luxury you earn. It should be infrastructure you inherit — like roads, or breathable air."** > — Elinor Frejd, HELIX Founder

> **"8,200 SEK per month, all-inclusive. Rent, utilities, food, mental health support. That's not charity — that's what happens when you remove profit extraction from the equation."**

> **"We're not 'disrupting' housing. We're building what housing would look like if it was designed for humans instead of investors."**
