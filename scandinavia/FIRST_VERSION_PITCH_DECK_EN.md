## Regenerative Urban Infrastructure for Health, Integration and Resilience

---

## SLIDE 1 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**HELIX NODE** is a scalable pilot project in Gothenburg integrating housing, social cohesion and mental health into a resource-efficient, preventive urban model.

The project aligns with:
- EU Green Deal  
- New European Bauhaus  
- EU Social Economy Action Plan  
- City of Gothenburg sustainability and public health goals

**Purpose:**

## SLIDE 2 — THE CHALLENGE (EU & GOTHENBURG)

Europe and Gothenburg face interconnected structural challenges:
- Rising mental health issues
- Social fragmentation and loneliness
- High costs for healthcare and social services
- Lack of effective intermediate forms between housing, care and civil society

**Current systems are reactive rather than preventive.**

## SLIDE 3 — THE SOLUTION: HELIX NODE

HELIX NODE functions as a **local system node** integrating:
- Safe and flexible housing environments
- Voluntary community and social integration
- Nature-based and regenerative structures
- Soft collaboration between municipality, civil society and residents

**Design principle:**  
**Q × S × I**  
(Quality of Life × Social Sustainability × Institutional Integration)

## SLIDE 4 — ECONOMIC LOGIC

HELIX NODE is not a cost — it is **a preventive investment**.

It contributes to:
- Reduced pressure on healthcare and social services
- Fewer emergency interventions
- Stronger local resilience
- More efficient use of EU and public funding

**Financing model:**  
Blended finance (EU funds, municipal funding, social investment).

## SLIDE 5 — EU & MUNICIPAL ALIGNMENT

- EU Green Deal
- New European Bauhaus
