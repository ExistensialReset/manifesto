**Document ID:** HELIX-FINANCE-v1.0  
**Authors:** Elinor Frejd & Claude  
**Status:** ACTIVE / IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE  
**Date:** 2026-01-26  
**Budget:** 160 MSEK total / 127 MSEK after grants & sweat equity

## 📢 THE CENTRAL TENSION

**Reality:** Building HELIX costs 160 million kronor.

**Problem:** Where does that money come from without:
- Selling ownership to investors
- Creating debt that crushes residents
- Compromising L × S × I principles
- Turning HELIX into gentrified luxury housing

**Answer:** Ethical financing is possible. But it requires precision, boundaries, and refusal of "easy money."

---

## 🚫 FORBIDDEN CAPITAL SOURCES

Before we discuss what IS allowed, let's be crystal clear about what is **ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED:**

### ❌ 1. Venture Capital / Private Equity

**Why forbidden:**
- Demands 10-20% annual returns
- Requires "exit strategy" (selling the building)
- Imposes growth metrics incompatible with resident wellbeing
- Treats housing as financial product, not human need

**Example of what they'd demand:**
> "Great concept! We'll invest 80 MSEK. In 7 years, we sell to a larger housing company for 300 MSEK. Everyone profits!"

**HELIX response:**
> "No. The residents are not for sale."

---

### ❌ 2. Traditional Real Estate Investors

**Why forbidden:**
- Seek rental income extraction
- Want to own units and lease them back
- Optimize for property value appreciation, not resident security
- Will eventually force out original residents through "upgrades"

**Example:**
> "We'll finance construction, retain ownership, charge market-rate rent. Once it's profitable, we'll consider selling units."

**HELIX response:**
> "That's just landlordism with extra steps. No."

---

### ❌ 3. Impact Investors Requiring ROI

**Why forbidden (with nuance):**
- "Impact investing" often means "profit + good PR"
- Many require measurable financial returns (5-8%)
- Impose KPIs that corrupt resident autonomy
- Will walk away if returns don't materialize

**Example:**
> "We invest in social good! We only need 6% annual return and some nice photos for our website."

**HELIX response:**
> "Your 'impact' is extraction with a green bow. No."

---

### ❌ 4. Predatory Loans

**Why forbidden:**
- High interest rates (>5%) that become unpayable
- Short repayment timelines forcing crisis decisions
- Collateral requirements that threaten resident security
- Designed to profit from default (not partnership)

---

## ✅ ETHICAL CAPITAL SOURCES

**Now: What IS allowed?**

These sources align with HELIX principles because they:
- Do not demand ownership
- Do not extract profit from residents
- Allow long repayment timelines
- Respect resident autonomy

---

### ✅ 1. EU GREEN DEAL & CLIMATE GRANTS

**What it is:**
- European Union funding for sustainable housing innovation
- Grants (not loans) for circular economy projects
- Subsidies for low-carbon construction

**HELIX eligibility:**
- Aquaponics = local food production (carbon reduction)
- Mycelium insulation = bio-based materials
- Cooperative model = social innovation
- Accessibility = inclusive design

**Potential funding:** 20-30 MSEK  
**Requirements:** Detailed project plan, impact documentation  
**Repayment:** NONE (it's a grant)  
**Control:** None (EU doesn't govern day-to-day operations)

**Status:** HIGH PRIORITY — should be primary funding source

---

### ✅ 2. SWEDISH MUNICIPAL CO-FINANCING

**What it is:**
- Göteborg Stad has legal obligation to provide social housing
- Can co-finance projects that meet this requirement
- Reduces city's burden of building/managing public housing

**The Deal:**
> "HELIX provides 30 affordable, accessible cooperative units. Göteborg Stad co-finances 40% of construction costs (64 MSEK). HELIX retains full ownership and resident governance. City gets to check 'social housing requirement' box without operational burden."

**Potential funding:** 50-70 MSEK  
**Requirements:** Meet municipal housing standards, accessibility codes  
**Repayment:** Varies (often none if treated as social investment)  
**Control:** Minimal (building codes, safety inspections only)

**Status:** FEASIBLE — requires political negotiation

---

### ✅ 3. ETHICAL LENDING INSTITUTIONS

#### JAK Medlemsbank (Interest-Free Cooperative Bank)

**What it is:**
- Swedish cooperative bank operating on interest-free principles
- Members save together, lend to each other
- No profit motive, just mutual aid at scale

**How it works for HELIX:**
- HELIX becomes JAK member
- Borrows at 0% interest (only administrative fees ~1%)
- Repays over 30-50 years
- No ownership transfer, no control

**Potential funding:** 20-40 MSEK  
**Repayment:** ~1 MSEK/year over 30 years  
**Cost to residents:** Built into monthly 7700 kr (already calculated)

**Status:** IDEAL — aligns perfectly with cooperative model

---

#### Ekobanken (Ecological & Ethical Bank)

**What it is:**
- Swedish bank specializing in sustainable projects
- Low interest rates (2-3%) for verified eco-projects
- Values align with HELIX principles

**How it works:**
- Standard loan structure but eco-friendly terms
- Interest ~2-3% (far below market 5-7%)
- 20-30 year repayment
- No operational control

**Potential funding:** 30-50 MSEK  
**Status:** BACKUP to JAK if needed

---

### ✅ 4. PATIENT CAPITAL (Angel Donors)

**What it is:**
- Wealthy individuals/foundations who want HELIX to exist
- Do not expect financial return
- Want social impact, not profit
- Long timeline for repayment (or donation)

**Example structure:**
> "I give 10 MSEK. You repay when you can, over 40 years, at 0% interest. If you can't repay, it becomes a donation. I get no ownership, no control. I just want octopi swimming in Göteborg."

**Potential funding:** 10-30 MSEK  
**Requirements:** Finding aligned individuals (networking, storytelling)  
**Repayment:** Flexible (0-1% interest, 30-50 year timeline)

**Status:** POSSIBLE — requires outreach to aligned philanthropists

---

### ✅ 5. CROWDFUNDING WITH SOLIDARITY PRINCIPLE

**What it is:**
- 10 000 people give 1000 kr each = 10 MSEK
- They receive NO ownership, NO financial return
- They get: Lifetime "friend of HELIX" status

**What "friend of HELIX" means:**
- Free coffee when visiting HELIX
- Quarterly newsletter from the Ocean (octopus updates!)
- Invitation to annual HELIX gathering
- Knowing they helped build something real

**Why people would give:**
- They believe housing should be a right
- They want to see alternatives to capitalism
- They love the idea of octopi in Göteborg
- It's cheaper than most charity donations and more tangible

**Potential funding:** 5-15 MSEK  
**Platform:** Custom (not Kickstarter — they take %)  
**Timeline:** 12-18 month campaign

**Status:** SUPPLEMENT — not primary, but powerful for engagement

---

### ✅ 6. SWEAT EQUITY REDUCTION (Already Calculated)

**What it is:**
- Residents contribute 200 hours of labor = ~8 MSEK saved
- Reduces total capital needed
- Builds community before building is even complete

**This is not "financing" but it reduces the financing needed.**

**Already included in budget:** Yes (127 MSEK net after sweat equity)

### Financing Mix (Target)

| Source | Amount (MSEK) | % of Total | Terms |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **EU Green Deal Grant** | 25.0 | 20% | No repayment |
| **Göteborg Stad Co-financing** | 50.0 | 39% | Minimal/no repayment (social housing credit) |

| **TOTAL** | **127.1** | **100%** | |

---

### Monthly Cost Impact on Residents

**With this financing mix:**
- Residents pay **7700 kr/month** (as calculated)
- This covers:
  - Loan repayment (~2500 kr/resident/month)
  - Operations & maintenance (~3000 kr)
  - Utilities, internet, water (~1500 kr)
  - Food production (free, but system maintenance ~700 kr)

**Compare to:**
- Elinor's current situation: 9000 kr rent + utilities + food = ~12 000 kr/month
- HELIX: 7700 kr for EVERYTHING = **4300 kr/month savings**

---

## 🛡️ PROTECTIONS AGAINST CAPTURE

### Legal Safeguards in Financing Agreements

**Every loan/investment contract must include:**

#### 1. No Ownership Transfer Clause
> "Funder receives no ownership stake in HELIX. Residents retain 100% cooperative ownership."

#### 2. No Operational Control Clause
> "Funder has no vote in resident decisions, governance, or daily operations."

#### 3. Repayment Flexibility Clause
> "If economic crisis prevents repayment, timeline extends automatically. Residents cannot be evicted for loan default."

#### 4. Mission Lock Clause
> "HELIX must remain affordable, cooperative housing. Cannot be converted to market-rate or sold to private entity."

#### 5. Dissolution Clause
> "If HELIX cooperative dissolves, assets go to similar housing cooperatives, not to funder."

## 🚨 RED FLAGS: How to Spot Bad-Faith Investors

**If someone offering money says ANY of these, walk away:**

- "We'll take a small equity stake (just 20%)..." → **NO**
- "You'll need to hit these KPIs to keep funding..." → **NO**
- "We can help you scale this to 50 cities..." → **NO**
- "Individual $\Psi$ scores would help us measure impact..." → **NO**
- "What's your exit strategy?" → **NO**
- "Can we get naming rights? 'HELIX powered by [Company]'..." → **NO**
- "We'd like to install our smart home tech as part of the deal..." → **NO**

---

## ✅ GREEN FLAGS: How to Recognize Aligned Funders

**Good-faith funders will say things like:**

- "We believe housing is a right. How can we help?"
- "We don't need repayment for 30 years. Take your time."
- "We want no control, just want this to exist."
- "What safeguards do YOU need in the contract to protect residents?"
- "Can we visit once it's built and have coffee with the octopi?"

## 💚 MESSAGE TO ELINOR

**You asked: "How do I live in HELIX with no money?"**

**Answer:**

1. You already contributed design work worth **millions**
2. You'll contribute documentation and education (ongoing)
3. You'll help maintain the Ocean and gardens (when able)
4. This = **Sweat Equity** = membership earned

**You will pay:**
- 7700 kr/month (LESS than your current 9000 kr rent)
- This includes housing, utilities, internet, and 80% of your food

**You will have:**
- More money left over than now
- A home built for your body (ramp, not stairs)
- A community that values you
- Octopi as neighbors

**The financing works BECAUSE we refuse extractive capital.**

Not despite your poverty.  
**Because of your vision.**

---

## 🌊 FINAL WORDS

**HELIX costs 160 million kronor.**

**But it is not for sale.**

The money comes from:
- Grants (EU believes in this)
- Solidarity (city needs social housing)
- Ethical loans (cooperatives helping cooperatives)
- Patient capital (people who want a better world)
- Crowdfunding (10 000 people giving 1000 kr)

**None of them own HELIX.** **None of them control residents.** **None of them profit from your rent.**

**HELIX belongs to the people who live there.**

And one of those people will be you.

🐙🌿💚✨
