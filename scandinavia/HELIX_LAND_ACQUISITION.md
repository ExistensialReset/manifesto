## Masthuggskajen Strategy: Securing the Site

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Purpose:** Concrete action plan for acquiring Masthuggskajen plot for HELIX Node Göteborg  
**Status:** PRE-NEGOTIATION (ready to execute)  
**Target:** 99-year land lease agreement signed by Q4 2027

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**The ask:** 2,500 m² building footprint + 500 m² rooftop/exterior (total 3,000 m² including vertical space) at Masthuggskajen, Göteborg

**Ownership structure:** Long-term land lease (tomträtt) from Göteborg Stad, not purchase (reduces capital requirement from 25 MSEK → 5 MSEK upfront + annual fee)

**Why this site:**
- **Harbor access:** Symbolic connection to Göteborg's maritime identity (Ocean system resonates with coastal culture)
- **Public transit:** 800m to Järntorget tram station (accessibility critical for car-free residents)
- **Development zone:** Masthuggskajen already designated for mixed-use redevelopment (we fit Stad's vision)
- **Visibility:** High foot traffic area (media/public interest, demonstration effect for replication)

**Competition:** Low (site underdeveloped for 8+ years, Stad struggling to find viable projects that serve public interest vs. luxury condos)

**Our advantage:** Social housing + food sovereignty + mental health infrastructure = aligns with Göteborg Stad's 2030 goals (climate, affordability, wellbeing)

**Timeline:**
- Q1 2026: Initial contact (Fastighetskontoret, Stadsbyggnadskontoret)
- Q2 2026: Formal proposal submitted (with prototype results, press coverage)
- Q3 2026: Negotiation (lease terms, co-financing, permit pathway)
- Q4 2027: Agreement signed, bygglov secured

## SECTION 1: SITE ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Physical Characteristics

**Address:** Masthuggskajen, 414 51 Göteborg (exact plot TBD, currently 3 candidate parcels)

**Site options:**



**Option A: "Kran-tomten" (Northern parcel, 3,200 m²)**
- Pros: Largest footprint, direct waterfront, existing road access
- Cons: Heritage crane on site (preservation constraints), higher scrutiny
- Soil: Harbor fill (10-12m piling to bedrock)

**Option B: "Mellan-tomten" (Central parcel, 2,800 m²) — RECOMMENDATION**
- Pros: Central location, equidistant to transit, Goldilocks size.
- Cons: Adjacent to planned hotel (temporary construction noise).
- Soil: Similar fill (10m piling)
- Zoning: Residential priority (fastest approval pathway)

**Option C: "Gröna-tomten" (Southern parcel, 3,500 m²)**
- Pros: Existing green space, quieter.
- Cons: Furthest from tram (1.2 km), requires rezoning (+12 months).

### 1.2 Regulatory Constraints

**Current zoning (Detaljplan Masthuggskajen 2021):**
- Permitted use: Residential, mixed-use, max 4 stories.
- Building coverage: 40% max (HELIX footprint 22% = ✅).
- Height restriction: 20m max (HELIX spiral ~18m = ✅).

**Environmental assessment (Miljökonsekvensbeskrivning):**
- Required for new construction >1,000 m².
- Focus: Water quality (Ocean discharge), biodiversity (bees), noise.
- Risk: Low (closed-loop system).

## SECTION 2: STAKEHOLDER MAPPING

### 2.1 Decision-Makers

**Fastighetskontoret (Property Department):**
- Key: Katarina Bergström, Fastighetschef.
- Focus: Revenue (lease fees) vs. social value.
- Pitch: HELIX reduces municipal health costs by 1.35 MSEK/year.

**Stadsbyggnadskontoret (City Planning):**
- Key: Anders Johansson, Plannchef.
- Focus: Compliance and architectural quality.
- Pitch: Landmark-quality bio-architecture.

**Stadsbyggnadsnämnden (Political Committee):**
- Key Influencers: Daniel Bernmar (V), Jonas Attenius (S).
- Pitch: Solves housing crisis at scale without developer profit extraction.

---

## SECTION 3: NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### 3.1 The Offer

**Land lease terms:**
- Duration: 99 years.
- Upfront: 5 MSEK (Social housing discount).
- Annual fee: 200,000 SEK (CPI-adjusted).

**Co-financing request:**
- 45 MSEK infrastructure grant justified by long-term healthcare savings.

### 3.2 The Pitch

**To Politicians:**
"HELIX is not an experiment; it's a tested model. Vote yes, and Göteborg leads Sweden on cooperative housing. Vote no, and Stockholm will do it first."

---

## SECTION 4: TIMELINE & MILESTONES

- **Q1 2026:** Groundwork. Formal proposal submitted. EU Green Deal application.
- **Q2 2026:** Prototype Completion. Media event. Invite Stad officials to the Ocean.
- **Q3 2026:** Formal Decision. Vote in Stadsbyggnadsnämnden.
- **Q4 2026 - Q3 2027:** Contract & Permits. Bygglov granted.

---

## SECTION 5: RISK MITIGATION

- **Risk: Outbid by luxury developers.**
  - Mitigation: Mobilize allies (Coompanion, Klimatkollektivet) to frame it as a political choice: "Dignity vs. Profit."
- **Risk: Permitting delays.**
  - Mitigation: Hire building permit specialists early; use political pressure to prioritize "Climate Pilot" projects.
