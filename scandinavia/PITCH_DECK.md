## Investing in Existential Sovereignty

**Slide 1: The Impossible Equation**
- Problem: Rent (9k) + Food (3k) + Utilities (1k) = 13,000 kr/month.
- Median income for disabled/low-income: 11,000 kr.
- **Result:** Systemic poverty and chronic stress.

**Slide 2: The HELIX Reset**
- Solution: A living building that grows food and lowers costs.
- Cost: **7,970 kr/month** (All-inclusive).
- Savings: **5,030 kr/month** back to the individual.

**Slide 3: Refugium Anima (The 30th Unit)**
- Crisis support is usually reactive (hospitals/police).
- HELIX is proactive: A 60m² dedicated sanctuary for sensory regulation and rest.
- Reducing the burden on public healthcare by providing architectural healing.

**Slide 4: The Ocean Economy**
- 29 residents fed by a 20m vertical aquaponics system.

- Biology replaces supply chains.

**Slide 5: Financing (160 MSEK)**
- Not a "real estate deal." A social infrastructure project.
- Mix of EU Green Grants, Municipal credits, and JAK Interest-free loans.
- ROI is measured in **Reduced Social Costs** and **Human Flourishing**.

**Slide 6: Ask**
- We need 127 MSEK in net financing.
