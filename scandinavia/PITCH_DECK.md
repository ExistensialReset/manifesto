## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

**Visual:** Split screen — left side: isolated person in gray apartment, stressed; right side: bills piling up

**Text:**

# Housing Today Extracts & Isolates

**The math doesn't work:**
- Average rent (60m²): 9,000 kr/month
- Food: 3,000 kr/month  
- Utilities: 1,000 kr/month
- **Total: 13,000+ kr/month**

**The human cost:**
- Loneliness epidemic (even in cities)
- Inaccessible for wheelchairs, chronic illness
- Dependence on fragile supply chains
- No community, no nature, no sovereignty

**People pay to survive, not to live.**

## SLIDE 3: THE VISION

**Visual:** HELIX cross-section showing: Soul Dwellings suspended, Ocean in center, ramp spiraling, gardens everywhere

**Text:**

# HELIX: A Building That Lives

**Imagine housing that:**
- 🐙 Grows 82% of your food (aquaponics + gardens)
- 💰 Costs LESS than rent (7,700 kr all-inclusive)
- ♿ Adapts to all bodies (ramps, soundproofing, sensory design)
- 🤝 Builds community without coercion (private + optional commons)

**Not a concept. A blueprint.**

## SLIDE 4: HOW IT WORKS — THE OCEAN

**Visual:** Beautiful photo/rendering of Ocean system — octopus swimming, prawns, mussels, plants below

**Text:**

# The Ocean: Heart of HELIX

**20-meter vertical aquaponics:**

**Upper Zone:** Octopi, prawns, salmon (6,000 kg/year)  
**Middle Zone:** Mussels filter water (biological purification)  
**Lower Zone:** Clean water feeds rice, coffee, fruits

**Annual production (30 residents):**
- Protein: 6,000 kg  
- Coffee: 500 kg  
- Fruits/Grains: 22,500 kg  
- Honey: 800 liters

**Self-sufficiency: 82%**

## SLIDE 5: HOW IT WORKS — SOUL DWELLINGS

**Visual:** Interior of Soul Dwelling — cozy, plants, sunlight, wheelchair-accessible bathroom, soundproofed walls

**Text:**

# Soul Dwellings: Your Private Sanctuary

**60m² suspended units:**
- Vibration-isolated (no neighbor noise)
- HEPA-filtered air (smoke-safe if desired)
- Total acoustic privacy (>40 dB isolation)
- Accessible bathroom + guest room
- Private control (light, temperature, sound)

**Principle:**  
Your home = your sovereign space.  
No surveillance. No rules about what you do inside.

## SLIDE 6: THE ECONOMICS

**Visual:** Simple infographic comparing conventional costs vs. HELIX

**Text:**

# The Numbers Work

**Total build cost:** 160 MSEK (~$15M USD)

**Financing mix:**
- EU Green Deal grants: 25 MSEK
- Göteborg Stad co-financing: 50 MSEK
- JAK Medlemsbank (0% loan): 30 MSEK
- Patient capital/donors: 15 MSEK
- Crowdfunding: 7.1 MSEK
- Sweat equity: 8 MSEK

**Monthly cost: 7,700 kr**  
(vs. 13,000+ kr conventional)

**= 5,300 kr/month savings**

## SLIDE 7: WHO IT'S FOR

**Visual:** Photos of diverse people — wheelchair user, family with kids, elderly person, young adult, all smiling

**Text:**

# Built for People the System Abandoned

**Membership pathways:**
1. **Sweat Equity:** 200 hours work over 2 years
2. **Sliding Scale:** Pay 0–200,000 kr (based on capacity)
3. **Temporal:** Contribute later when able

**No discrimination based on:**
- Income, debt, credit score
- Disability, chronic illness
- Age, background, housing history

**Principle:** Housing is a right, not earned through wealth.

## SLIDE 8: THE PHILOSOPHY — L × S × I

**Visual:** Three icons with brief explanations

**Text:**

# L × S × I: The Foundation

**L — Lugn (Calm)**  
Soundproofing, private control, baseline security  
→ Nervous system can finally rest

**S — Spontanitet (Spontaneity)**  
Your space, your rules (smoke, music, harvest at 3 AM)  
→ Freedom without harming others

**I — Inkännande (Empathy)**  
System protects all (clean air/water, conflict resolution)  
→ Community through care, not coercion

**If any → 0, quality of life collapses.**

## SLIDE 9: TIMELINE & REPLICATION

**Visual:** Roadmap graphic showing phases

**Text:**

# From Prototype to Movement

**Q2 2026:** Prototype (1:10 scale)  
Test systems, learn, iterate

**Q3 2027:** Break ground (Masthuggskajen)

**2027-2029:** Construction  
Mycelium, Soul Dwellings, Ocean

**Q1 2030:** First residents move in

**PRESENTATION NOTES (for you when presenting):**

**Slide 1:** Start with personal story — "I'm Elinor. Wheelchair user, bipolar, diabetes. 3000 kr/month after rent. The math didn't work."

**Slide 2:** Make them FEEL the problem — "How many of you spend >50% of income on housing? How many feel lonely despite living in cities?"

**Slide 3:** Shift energy — "But what if we designed differently?"

**Slide 4:** Let them marvel — "Yes, octopi. In Göteborg. Swimming in your building. Producing your food."

**Slide 5:** Make it personal — "Imagine coming home to total quiet. Your space. Your rules."

**Slide 6:** Address skepticism — "I know what you're thinking: 'too expensive.' Look at the financing."

**Slide 7:** Emphasize inclusion — "This is for people who've been told 'you don't qualify.' Here, you qualify by being human."

**Slide 8:** Ground in philosophy — "This isn't just clever architecture. It's a different way of being together."

**Slide 9:** Show momentum — "Prototype this year. Full build by 2030. Then we replicate."

**Slide 10:** Clear ask — "We need you. Which role will you play?"
