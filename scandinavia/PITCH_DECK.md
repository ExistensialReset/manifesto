## SLIDE 1: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Challenge
Sweden faces three intersecting crises:
1.  **Housing Accessibility Crisis:** 9.2-year wait time in Göteborg; market rates for 60m² average 13,000 SEK (total cost).
2.  **Mental Health Emergency:** 15% chronic anxiety/depression; ER visits up 40% (2019-2024).
3.  **Food System Vulnerability:** 50% food import rate; <2% urban production capacity.

### The Solution
**HELIX Node Göteborg:** A 30-unit cooperative housing development integrating:
* **29 Soul Dwellings:** Fully accessible, soundproofed, universal design.
* **1 Refugium Anima:** Crisis sanctuary for residents (zero-threshold access).
* **The Ocean:** Integrated aquaponics system targeting 70% food self-sufficiency.
* **Bio-Architecture:** Mycelium-based carbon-negative construction.
* **Radical Affordability:** 8,200 SEK/month all-inclusive (saving 4,800 SEK vs. market).

## SLIDE 2: PROJECT FUNDAMENTALS (L × S × I)



### Core Design Principles
* **L (Lugn / Calm):** Acoustic isolation >40 dB; individual climate/humidity control (<70% RH).
* **S (Spontanitet / Spontaneity):** No coercive scheduling; full agency over private space; 24/7 amenity access.
* **I (Inkännande / Interconnection):** Shared biological systems; transparent restorative justice framework; optional sociality.

### Legal Status
* **Entity:** Ekonomisk förening (Cooperative Association).
* **Governance:** One-member-one-vote; anti-capture bylaws preventing external acquisition.

## SLIDE 3: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Building Specifications
* **Structure:** 4-story spiral ramp structure (2% incline) – 100% elevator-independent.
* **Materials:** Mycelium composite insulation (R-value 4.2); Steel frame; Passive house windows (0.8 W/m²K).
* **Accessibility:** Sensory-controlled lighting (warm spectrum); tactile navigation; universal design.

### Biological Systems: "The Ocean"
* **Aquaponics (20 m³):** Tilapia, rainbow trout, Pacific white shrimp, Sepia officinalis, and blue mussels.
* **Hydroponics (200 m²):** Leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, and Arabica coffee.
* **Pollinators:** 10 onsite beehives (estimated 400L honey/year).

## SLIDE 4: REFUGIUM ANIMA — Crisis Infrastructure

**Purpose:** 24/7 non-coercive crisis support to reduce ER dependency.

| Room | Purpose | Key Feature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cry Room** | Somatic Regulation | Accessible bathtub (reduces cortisol 18-24%) |
| **Silent Room** | Sensory Recovery | Blackout capability; sound isolation; sleep focus |
| **Creation Room** | Gentle Re-engagement | Biophilic views; art/music materials; low-pressure play |

**Outcome Target:** 60% reduction in ER visits for residents; 1.35 MSEK annual municipal savings.
