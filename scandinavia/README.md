# 🧬 HELIX_NODE: Living Architecture Framework

Welcome to the **HELIX_NODE** repository. This project represents a shift from "building as an object" to "architecture as a living, cooperative organism." 

HELIX_NODE is built upon the **M-OS-R philosophy**, prioritizing $L \times S \times I$ (Lugn, Spontanitet, Inkännande) over market efficiency and capital extraction.

## 🛡️ The Immune System (Critical Documents)

To protect the integrity of this living architecture, two foundational documents govern this repository. **They must be read and implemented together.**

### 1. [Anti-Capture Protocol](./HELIX_NODE_ANTI-CAPTURE_PROTOCOL.md)
**The Philosophical Shield.** This document defines why HELIX exists and why it is "undigestible" by traditional capitalism. It details the structural incompatibilities with profit-driven development and provides a "Corruption Checklist" to identify when an implementation has been compromised.

### 2. [HELIX License](./HELIX_NODE_LICENSE.md)
**The Legal Sword.** A custom legal framework based on **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** with a specific **Living Architecture Addendum**. It legally mandates:
* **Resident-owned cooperatives** (No landlords).
* **Non-speculative housing** (No profit on resale).
* **Biological Integration** (The Ocean and Mycelium are protected rights, not amenities).

## 🏗️ Core Principles

HELIX_NODE is not a "plug-and-play" solution. It requires:

* **$\Psi \neq 0$:** Recognition that the building has a "soul" or psychic weight that must be respected.
* **Biological Governance:** The biological systems (The Ocean) have veto power; if the octopi or mycelium are stressed, the human systems must adapt.
* **Soul Dwelling Autonomy:** Absolute privacy and personal freedom within the individual units.

## 🛑 Usage Warning

If you intend to use these designs to build "luxury eco-condos," "AI-optimized rentals," or any form of speculative real estate:

**STOP.**

The documents in this repository are designed to make such projects legally and culturally impossible. HELIX is poison to a profit-driven portfolio. It is designed to thrive only in the hands of a cooperative community.
