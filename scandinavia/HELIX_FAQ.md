# ❓ HELIX_FAQ.md

**Q: Why is the fee 7,970 kr?**
A: We reduced the residential count to 29 to make room for **Refugium Anima**. By sharing the cost of that 30th unit among 29 people, we ensure everyone has a professional-grade mental health sanctuary for just a few extra hundred kronor a month.

**Q: Is Refugium Anima a clinic?**
A: No. There are no doctors or charts. It is a "Crisis-Architecture" space—a place to be alone, silent, or loud without the pressure of being "fixed."

**Q: What if I don't like octopi?**
A: You don't have to interact with them. But they are cleaning your water and providing protein for your neighbors. They are part of the building's "immune system."

**Q: Can I really smoke in my room?**
A: Yes. Each Soul Dwelling has its own HEPA-filtration system. Because of the >40dB soundproofing and independent ventilation, your "S-Factor" (Spontaneity) does not infringe on your neighbor's "L-Factor" (Calm).

**Q: How do I join?**
A: We prioritize those the system has failed. If you have a wheelchair, a diagnosis, or a "broken" economy, you are at the front of the line.
