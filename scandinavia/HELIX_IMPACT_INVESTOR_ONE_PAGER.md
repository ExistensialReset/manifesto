## Resilient Urban Infrastructure for the Next Generation of Cities

**Audience:** Impact investors, public-private funds, development banks  
**Investment type:** Infrastructure / Long-term systems  
**Stage:** Pilot → Scale

---

## THE PROBLEM

Cities are facing:
- Overloaded water and energy infrastructure
- Rising health and wellbeing costs
- Increasing climate volatility
- Aging, brittle building systems

Traditional buildings consume resources but do not contribute resilience.

---

## THE SOLUTION

HELIX_NODE transforms buildings into **active resilience assets**.

Each HELIX building:
- Reduces dependency on centralized systems
- Improves air and water quality locally
- Enhances human wellbeing and social stability
- Operates as a modular, maintainable system

HELIX treats buildings as infrastructure, not real estate products.

---

## WHY NOW

- Infrastructure renewal costs are rising rapidly
- Climate adaptation funding is increasing
- Cities need solutions that can deploy fast, locally, and safely

HELIX fits existing policy and funding logic without regulatory disruption.

---

## BUSINESS & VALUE LOGIC

Value creation through:
- Reduced operational costs
- Public-sector co-financing
- Long-term asset value increase
- Replication across sites

Revenue and return are driven by infrastructure performance, not user extraction.

---

## RISK PROFILE

HELIX is intentionally low-risk:
- Proven subsystems
- Redundant fail-safe architecture
- Municipal fallback integration
- Clear ownership and responsibility

This is defensive, long-term capital logic.

---

## SCALABILITY

HELIX scales through:
- Modular replication
- Standardized components
- Local partnerships

Applicable to:
- Residential housing
- Healthcare facilities
- Campuses
- Public buildings

---

## IMPACT

- Reduced urban environmental load
- Improved public health indicators
- Increased system transparency
- Higher resilience per invested euro

---

## SUMMARY

HELIX is not a bet on behavior change.  
It is an investment in **structural resilience**.

Built once.  
Pays back for decades.
