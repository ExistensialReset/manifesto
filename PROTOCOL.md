# PROTOCOL.md

**Operational mechanisms for protecting the Baseline and preserving Sovereignty.**

This protocol defines the technical and logistical execution of the principles stated in the Manifesto of Existential Sovereignty. Its primary function is to maintain system stability without infringing on individual agency.

## §1. BASELINE PROTECTION MECHANISM (BPM)

The Baseline is a system constant. The BPM ensures its delivery through logistical physics, not moral judgment.

### 1.1 Priority Flow
Logistical allocation follows a hardcoded priority:
1.  **Baseline Maintenance:** 100% fulfillment of food, clothes, healthcare, medicine, housing, and internet.
2.  **Critical Reserve Replenishment:** Maintaining the 30% buffer.
3.  **Secondary Flow:** All other societal participation and individual desires.

### 1.2 Automatic Reversion
The return to the Baseline is a default system function. 
* No application, eligibility test, or behavioral assessment is required. 
* If an individual’s participation ceases, the system automatically maintains the Baseline at the individual's last known logistical point of access.

## §2. FLOW INTEGRITY

Flow Integrity measures the health of the system's movement. It monitors friction, not people.

### 2.1 Stress Indicators (Mammon-Leakage)
System health is monitored by identifying **Mammon-leakage**: the introduction of debt, conditional access, or leverage mechanisms that bypass Priority Flow. **Mammon-leakage is treated as a system fault, not a behavioral violation.**

### 2.2 Systemic Intervention
When Flow Friction reaches defined thresholds, the system triggers a **time-bound Logistical Audit** of the infrastructure—not of individuals—until Flow Friction returns below the threshold.

## §3. LEX ULTIMA FINIS (The Final Compatibility Protocol)

Lex Ultima Finis defines the technical resolution of legacy debt systems to ensure compatibility with Flow-Logic.

### 3.1 System Incompatibility
Debt instruments (private, corporate, or sovereign) are classified as non-executable pre-Baseline artifacts. They are structurally incompatible with Priority Flow and are deactivated upon system launch.

### 3.2 Existential Nullification
All legacy debt records are marked as **Existentially Null (EN)**. This status indicates no claim on present or future Flow and no enforcement mechanism.

---

## §4. LEX CUSTODIA (The Shield)

Lex Custodia ensures the integrity of the architecture during transitional phases.

### 4.1 Logistical Veto
A temporary Freeze Function exists solely to block decisions that threaten the Critical Reserve or attempt to re-introduce debt-based leverage. **The Freeze Function is strictly temporary and expires automatically once the triggering condition is resolved.**

### 4.2 Transparency Mandate
Any activation of a Veto must be met with an immediate, public, and technical justification, ensuring Irresistible Transparency.

**PROTOCOL EXISTS TO PROTECT THE MANIFESTO FROM REALITY — NOT TO ENFORCE THE MANIFESTO ONTO REALITY.**
