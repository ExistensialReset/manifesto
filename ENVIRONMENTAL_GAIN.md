# Realistic Global Environmental and Resource Potential

This analysis is based on verified data from FAO, IMF, IEA, and academic research, showing how humanity's environmental footprint could realistically be reduced through scientifically supported actions.

## 1. Food Waste

Globally, approximately one-third of all produced food is lost or wasted (FAO, 2022):

- 13.2% loss in production and distribution chains  
- 17% lost at consumer and retail level  

**Potential impact if food waste is halved**:  

- Climate: Total agricultural emissions could be reduced by **8–10%** (WRI, 2019)  
- Resources: Reduced land use, water use, and energy for cultivation, transport, and storage  
- Waste: Less food waste reduces landfill emissions, especially methane  

## 2. Fossil Fuel Subsidies

Global fossil fuel subsidies amount to **$7 trillion per year** (IMF, 2023). These subsidies impede investments in renewable energy.

**Potential impact if subsidies are phased out**:  

- Climate: Global CO₂ emissions could decrease by **around 28%** (IMF, 2021)  
- Health: Millions fewer deaths from air pollution  
- Economy: $7 trillion annually freed for investments in green energy, health, and education  

## 3. Planned Obsolescence

Products are often designed for short lifespans, increasing resource use and waste. Electronic waste is the fastest-growing global waste stream.

**Potential impact if addressed**:  

- Resources: Significantly reduced need for new raw materials (metals, plastics, energy)  
- Waste: E-waste and plastic waste could decrease **20–30%** through “right to repair,” reuse, and long-life design  

## 4. Renewable Energy

Solar and wind power have very low CO₂ emissions in operation. The technical potential for global renewable electricity production far exceeds demand (IRENA, 2023; IEA, 2023).

**Potential impact of large-scale deployment**:  

- Climate: 75–90% of global electricity could come from solar and wind by 2050  
- CO₂ emissions: Direct reduction in the power sector of **around 30%** globally if fossil subsidies are also removed  
- Energy efficiency: Lower energy use per unit of service strengthens the effect of renewables  

## 5. Circular Economy and Recycling

Reusing, repairing, and recycling materials reduces the need for virgin resources:  

- Aluminum: Recycled aluminum reduces CO₂ emissions by **95–96%** compared to primary production  
- Materials: Less mining, deforestation, and plastic production  
- Waste: Reduced landfill and hazardous waste  

**Overall potential**: Efficient circular economy practices can reduce waste and resource extraction by **20–30%** over the medium term (20–30 years).  

## 6. Combined Realistic Impact over 20–30 Years

If the world aggressively implements verified actions:

- **Climate**: ~30% lower global CO₂ emissions  
- **Resources & waste**: ~20–30% reduction in global waste and raw material extraction  
- **Economy**: $7 trillion per year freed from fossil fuel subsidies  

The greatest environmental gains come from eliminating known inefficiencies rather than a total systemic shift. The technology for this transition exists, and research supports the core ideas of the manifesto.
